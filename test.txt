3	B004K4RY9M	I am a person who has always enjoyed word game and thiis one  is excellent. After a hard day, I can unwind with it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love this.  I try to beat my own time to see how fast I can complete.  Keeps your mind working.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is fun and it can also be alearning game.  I recomend for ages 7 and up. This is a good focus game for all ages.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy these puzzles have books of them keep you entertained for hours. great game and it is unlimited!!! o
3	B004K4RY9M	Have spent many enjoyable hours playing this game and would recomment it to others. This game helps to keep my mind sharp.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love scrabble and word games and this is a nice quiet game when you need to play without calling attention to yourself.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game occupies my time when I need to take a breather between reading my book.  May be a game I tire of quickly
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy this game overall, more so initially after downloading it. But there's something about this game that wears on my nerves over time. It's still enjoyable, but in small doses. If you like word search puzzles, you'll like it, I'm sure but be prepared you might have second thoughts.
3	B004K4RY9M	I've always loved doing search a words and this one is really neat. I like the idea that there are not a lot of words to search for while being timed.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love testing my speed.  It's an easy and fun game.  Anyone, at about any age can play.  Keeps your mind quick.
3	B004K4RY9M	i like to find words and and this is easy to do and my grand daughter likes this one too
3	B004K4RY9M	Good game to play to make the time pass by! I get really into this game! I have a hard time putting it down!
1	B004K4RY9M	at first it was fun but then it got boring fast. i rather buy an activity book then play this app, maybe then i could play a hard one with out the words getting cut off.
3	B004K4RY9M	played great on my Sgs4g. I recommend think app to anyone who likes wordsearch puzzles. would like the option of playing the game in land scape mode though. then it would be totally awesome
1	B004K4RY9M	I love word searches, but found this version to be way too easy.  I didn't find any of the games challenging.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is not extremely challenging but does serve to fill time while waiting for an appointment, test results, etc when one doesn't want to engage in a more detailed activity.
3	B004K4RY9M	I play wordsearch when I have time to kill or need a diversion.  The game is a little too simple
3	B004K4RY9M	I  LIKE  THIS  APP  BECAUSE  I  LIKE  PUZZLES.  IT'S  EASY  TO  READ.  I  HAVE  BEEN  DOINGIT  SO  MUCH  I  THINK  I'M  DOING  THE  SAME  PUZZLE'S.  I  WOULD  RECOMMEND  THIS  APP.
2	B004K4RY9M	I love word search and even though the lettering is small, it's still something fun to play on my Kindle. Would recommend.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like the wordsearch puzzle on my new Kindle Fire.  It is fun to play and I have been playing it since I got the kindle.
2	B004K4RY9M	Good for waiting in the doctor's office or for short-term entertainment. Not a huge challenge, but it works well with my grandkids when I'm trying to keep their energy level to a minimum.
3	B004K4RY9M	A little mundane but I like it when the day has been long and thought provoking. Willing to keep it
3	B004K4RY9M	This game works your brain while having fun.  May increase your vocabulary.  Smart Fun!  Great for a long plane ride. Doesn't burn the Kindle battery like some apps do. Has a timer to compete again your personal best.
3	B004K4RY9M	Working well on my Evo Shift. It's a fun, easy way to kill some time. There are a lot of different backgrounds, and you can focus on particular types of words, like flowers or vocabulary words.And the only &quot;misspellings&quot; I've found are actually UK spelling (like defence instead of defense) as opposed to US spelling. No problem here. :-)
2	B004K4RY9M	did not like this was unable to find the words.  I did not think my word bank was so limited.  hard to try and play
3	B004K4RY9M	Word search games are great. A nice little workout for your brain is just what people need in the evening.
3	B004K4RY9M	I've always enjoyed word search games.  My husband and I like to do the ones on the mats at restaurants and race to finish first.  I like racing against the clock with this game.  Only drawback is sometimes it clears the word I'm trying to highlight.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really liked it but it is irritating when you trace the word so many time and it does not stay lite.  With it being timed, it affects your scores.
3	B004K4RY9M	My husband enjoys playing it on my Kindle rather than on paper. I love it too! In fact, my whole family loves it.
2	B004K4RY9M	this was a good app to download i am happy i got it it is hours of fun !! yeah
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a favorite game of my wife and myself as we enjoys word search puzzles in the newspaper and work search books.
2	B004K4RY9M	One of those games good for mind-eye coordination but gets boring with one or two plays in a row.  Good if u find yourself in a waiting room with nothing to do.
3	B004K4RY9M	GREAT app for relaxing or just killing time  not a real brain teaser but it is excellent for a little of MY TIME  keep up the great stream of apps that appeal to young and old  Don
3	B004K4RY9M	I can't stop playing this game; it is very addictive. I have always liked the paper version but the kindle version is fabulous.
3	B004K4RY9M	This version of word search is easy, but hard to play! It keeps you going once you start, and the letters are easy to look at!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a game it gives you the words and you find them in the wodd search this would be apropriate for children to play
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun game searching for words in a 6X6 letter format. It is relatively easy to play and easier to learn. My only reservation is that there is a certain pattern to where the words are located so I did find myself searching in place for a word instead of searching for the particular words. Could be a little more challenging.
2	B004K4RY9M	Didn't like this word search game as well as others I have had in past and have deleted it from my list of games.
2	B004K4RY9M	I wish it would give you all the words at once instead of just a few. Otherwise it is a good time waster.Donna
3	B004K4RY9M	Makes you think and keeps your mind active.  It is very relaxing.  Helps me to tune out my husbandand other distractions in my life
3	B004K4RY9M	I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED WORDSEARCH, EVEN AS A LITTLE GIRL......THIS HELPS TO KEEP YOUR MEMORY IN TACT.....I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.
3	B004K4RY9M	Thisis a very challeinging game, I play it over and over and neverget tired of it. it is very brain stimulating.
2	B004K4RY9M	This game is good if you are just beginning these types of gamrs, but if you are an advanced word searcher this will be below your level of mastery.
3	B004K4RY9M	It is good to have it offline. I take my kindle almost everywhere and I don't always have Internet access.
3	B004K4RY9M	Really good pass time.  Makes you learn and think at the same time.  Good for the grandchildren to play instead of silly games
3	B004K4RY9M	Great for killing time if you like word searches. haven't had any trouble with crashes, but we'll see how it goes
3	B004K4RY9M	Excellent game that I use daily. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys word search games and would buy again.
3	B004K4RY9M	I do enjoy these, my finger seems to big so would probably be better with a stylus, which I a getting. Would get it again, can't complain really with it be free!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great puzzle word seak and find game.  I just can't get enough with kindle fire and prime what a value for your money
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this game.  I never saw it before.  It's too small on my IPod Touch, but on my Kindle Fire HD, it works great and is just a lot of fun.  Good responsiveness to touch and keeps you on your toes.  I love when they give fun stuff like this for free!
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like this game.  The words are challenging and not too simple.  Ads are not obnoxious and doesn't get in the way of the game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy playing this game. It could have a bit more difficulty but other than that it is a good game.
3	B004K4RY9M	bought this game for my daughter and she loves it. she found it very easy to learn to play this.
3	B004K4RY9M	Bought this for my Kindle Fire. Works great. Fun game not a real challenging game by any means.  But nice game to play when you have a few minutes to kill. Worth the small price.
1	B004K4RY9M	not great for free on kindle fire. there r only 70-some levels while the full version has like 140 levels. don't be cheap if you want a good game. if you like these types of games check out fruit ninjas, angry birds, office jerk, the moron test, paper toss, drawer, espn, Doodle jump, and minecraft.
2	B004K4RY9M	Word search is a quiet time game - no big challenges but helps to keep the brain working. Sometimes the screen response is a little cumbersome, but still enjoyable.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is the same at the larger books you can purchase. You get the names you are looking for and , if you are in the mood to cheat a bit, it will give you hints. It seems to get progressively more difficult. This will certainly save a lot of cash by not purchasing books.
1	B004K4RY9M	It was entertaing at first but then it started giving me random letters instead of actual words. For Example I got Sth as a word. What kind of word is that? Not worth it.
3	B004K4RY9M	A nice simple way to spend your time.  Quick puzzles and relaxing time. They would be good for kids to learn how to do word search.
3	B004K4RY9M	Here again I have trouble getting into the word search Unlimited free site.  I am ready to take all of them off it I can't figure out how it get it on the screen.
3	B004K4RY9M	I do enjoy searching for the words.  I am very pleased with it and use it on a daily basis.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game. It is a challenge to beat the time limit and it don't ask you to go on facebook. I just want to play a game and not challenge anyone on face book. Put more game on like this.
2	B004K4RY9M	I personally didn't care for this game.  Someone that does crossword puzzles and word searches would enjoy this.  One who likes to read would no doubt like this
3	B004K4RY9M	I like it, it works for me when I'm bore. Works for my lil sister as well and she loves it.
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is awesome! I use it once everyday as a mind wake up call! I highly recommend it for a daily workout for the brain.
1	B004K4RY9M	to me its easy. but thats the problem. its so easy that it gets really really boring. there should be an easy medium and hard mode. i think this is on super duper easy
3	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded WordSearch just two weeks ago and I'm HOOKED!!  So much fun. I play while having my hair done each week; I play in my doctor's office; I play while having lunch; I play everywhere. It's the best word game I've ever had. One caution ... the game is apparently from Britain so some of the spelling might throw you off a bit ("gaol" rather than "jail" for example) but it's really not that bad. It's a free download so I say, have a go and have fun.
2	B004K4RY9M	its kinda fun but thats mainly it theres no subjects u can pick and they pick the words randomly. but hey this is just my opinion
3	B004K4RY9M	As I get older, I find that my brain power needs a little excersize. I can do this with this game. It is not complicate, but still challenges your brain. So for just starting it's great. Until something more challenging comes around. I would recommend this game especially to people my age.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like to keep my mind working and always thinking!  I also like the fact that it's free, just don't like advertisements!
3	B004K4RY9M	Love this game.  Always enjoyed word search games.  Words are hidden very cleverly and not simple words - love the challenge.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy puzzle games of any kind especially word searches.  It is easy and fun game to play.  Like it very much
3	B004K4RY9M	its fun to play it and it helps me keep up with my spelling and speed I use it most while Im waiting at the Doctor office
2	B004K4RY9M	I would have preferred to be able to create my own words rather that try finding words on an established list.
2	B004K4RY9M	The only problem I have with this game is how you get to the settings to make changes.  I inadvertently got to the settings screen but don't know how to pull it up intentionally.  I guess I will figure it out eventually.
2	B004K4RY9M	It's ok.  I don.t use often but it also is mind expanding.  I'll continue to use, but not as often.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a very fun game. passes the time and also good for the mind. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys games.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like word search this is for you!  It is a great game to pass time while you are traveling or sitting in a waiting room.  Typical word search but good to have on your kindle.
3	B004K4RY9M	great to keep working ones mind looking for the words, specially with the  figgernt design in the letters you have to select from
3	B004K4RY9M	Another great game, because I love word games. Just need to pick up my speed on the seaching. Love it!
3	B004K4RY9M	great game. I like it a lot, finding words is so good for your brain, that's why this game is so great.
3	B004K4RY9M	Word searching helps me to exercise my eyes.While eye, brain activity is going on, I am re-acquainting with the spelling of words I don't use on a daily basis.
2	B004K4RY9M	I like word search but find the screen is set up where some of the letters are hard to see.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you love word games then this is the game for you.  Challenging at times but yet not too challenging.  It's fun and entertaining and you can while away the time and increase your spelling and brain power at the same time.
1	B004K4RY9M	It keeps sticking, not responding and doesn't work.I like word puzzles, but unfortunately this is not one, I'd keep using!
3	B004K4RY9M	I love the simplicity of this game.  The chalkboard theme is great.  The only thing I would like to see is a larger puzzle more full of words to search for.
3	B004K4RY9M	Even though this game has some problems I like it. It tests your ability and keeps your brain alert. But there are some problems in how it is played. Tracing your finger over the letters the app sometimes does not accept the word which is very frustrating.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a fun and quick game.  I like it because it is not repeating the puzzles over and over.  Nice for a break.  I like word games and this one is a lot of fun.
2	B004K4RY9M	When you just want to pass the time, this is a great app to use. Anyone that has used word search books over the years will love this great mobile version.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is fun!I love the format and had fun playing. I do not have wi-fi at home, so being able to download and play for days without wi-fi is a tremendous factor.The game is quick, challenging and very entertaining. A great way to spend my leisure time. Go Amazon, for offering 1st quality, really good games!
2	B004K4RY9M	I found this Word Search to be a little difficult because of the font of the letters.  Don't think I will play it very much.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a very simple game and I love that about it. It works really well on the Kindle Fire, no big graphics or sound effects just good old fashion find words in a maze. It is the digital version of crosswords without the detective work or sometimes misleading clues. I really enjoy it, it keeps your eyes and mind focus. The fact that it is timed keeps your heart racing to beat your own time, like a race against yourself. I love the simple themes you can choose whichever is most pleasing and easiest for your eyes. I would recommend this game, I play it regularly and use as a complement to Words With Friends.
3	B004K4RY9M	I think that my husband put this on my Kindle for himself.But we both like word puzzles and this will be a great way to stay occupied while waiting for appointments.
1	B004K4RY9M	Mucho que desear, es muy basica y solo tiene palabras en ingles, para la KF HD 8.9 el formato de letra es muy peque&ntilde;o y poco personalizable
3	B004K4RY9M	A goof word search for the Kindle Fire but lags a little bit at times.  Helps pass the time if I am waiting for some reason or other and am tired of reading a book or playing Mahjong.  Good app for the Kindle.
1	B004K4RY9M	This too wouldn't install properly for Android 2.2.  If it would install without error I would very much like to download it again and give it a whirl.  I always did love wordsearch.
2	B004K4RY9M	I find it very hard to get the machine to acknowledge that I have found the word.I spend more time getting it to click.  Otherwise, I enjoy the game.
1	B004K4RY9M	Wasn't pleased with this game.  Not enough words and the words were too easy. Needed to get a different puzzle & up grade it as well.  Thanks for trying though. Just not for an adult.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is one of the first games I downloaded when I got the Kindle Fire.  It is good but then I got bored with it.
1	B004K4RY9M	wordsearch was very big advertising heavy program. I deleted the game shortly after downloading it. I would not download it again
1	B004K4RY9M	I purchased this to pass the time.  It is very simplistic and not very interesting.  I wouldn't highly recommend this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I found each puzzle challenging but not impossible. It helps keep the grey cells functioning and I love the fact it is FREE.
3	B004K4RY9M	A true sense of building words by locating letters from each word no matter the direction.  Great learning tool for everyone.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have carried a book of word searches in my vehicle for years. I can spend a few minutes or a long time playing.  I love this version and I assume this 'book' will never end - that's great. You do have to be careful when highlighting words because it doesn't always think you are on the word so you have to try again which slows down your time.  I like it alot.
3	B004K4RY9M	It is a  great game to play. I love this version. It is just right for my kindle fire hd.
3	B004K4RY9M	I don't do word searches all the time. I'm not looking for something overly challenging, just something to keep me occupied while I wait in line etc. That said, I love this word search. It's nothing fancy - your basic word search but it's fun. I'll definitely keep it.
2	B004K4RY9M	Would like to have one with more and longer words, more challenging, for adults.  I'm older and don't get out much, so I'm easily bored.
2	B004K4RY9M	Would be great for kids or someone who just wants something easy to do.  I find it kind of boring.
2	B004K4RY9M	it's ok like being in timer it pushes you to look harder to find words faster. better than holding paper and pencil in hand. I play often still.
3	B004K4RY9M	I play this game when there is me time at work, and others are doing something else. Its another brain game !
3	B004K4RY9M	i like it its a new hit game that every one plays who ever came up with this rocks thank you so much have a good day ( smile)
2	B004K4RY9M	For a free game, it's ok. You Don't get very many words, and after you finish you have to go thru listing it and than arrow back to it and than click next to get to a different puzzle. Took a little bit to figure out how to get to next puzzle. But like I said, free.
3	B004K4RY9M	Really enjoy this game.  It can be challanging if you realize the game is timing your progress.  Not many words but not always as easy as it looks at first.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love it great mind game watching TV and enjoying a mind game is great make you focus on the Mind game and not eating.
3	B004K4RY9M	Easy entertainment for me and a learning tool for my young grandson.  Great for some quiet time.Developed good concentration.  Recommend it
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a good game to play when you have a short amount of time to kill.  The words are varied enough in length to make each board interesting.  This is a good game for people who like finding order out of kaos.
1	B004K4RY9M	I had difficulty keeping the letters lined up when I found them so i could get credit for it.  The stylus would slip and the letters forming the word didn't line up so I had to start over again... no fun.  This finally began so much of a problem, I deleted the game.  It might be fine for others, but it just didn't work out for me.  It became more frustrating than fun.
1	B004K4RY9M	I have removed it from my Kindle.  It was very hard to use.  Highlighting words was difficult and sometimes impossible.  It was also very easy, more for young kids than anything.
3	B004K4RY9M	Kept me busy for hours.  Not just finding the word, but spelling it too.  AND a timer!I'd recommend this for any age.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is extremely fun to play.  I really like doing the word searches every time I get a chance to play I am playing this game.  I like it because you don't have to be on the internet to play it.  Like some of the games I have on the kindle.Our grandson loves to do the word searches.
1	B004K4RY9M	this app needs improvement, its ok but the words are too easily found and the words are too easy as well
3	B004K4RY9M	Pretty cool game - the only thing I would change is the sensitivity of your finger as you drag it along the word as you find the letters .  Other than that great app!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun & addictive game. All the time I try to get a faster & faster time. My only issue with this game is some of the background choices make seeing the words a little difficult to see. But you can choose from different backgrounds. I just wish they offered additional ones. Besides that, the game is great!
3	B004K4RY9M	And, you don't have to erase.  Easier to spot words because of larger size on my i-pad.  This is a great update of the game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always enjoyed word finders.  This app challenges you with beating your time to find 8 words. Great for passing idle time away!
3	B004K4RY9M	Great time killer and the word searches get progressively harder. A great app to get! Love everything about it! You must get this app
3	B004K4RY9M	I would list the pros and cons, but there really isn't much to say about this game.  It challenges me and holds my interest.  I have experienced no issues with functionality.  Besides, games like this are great for keeping the mind sharp as we age.  Figured I would get an early start.(smile)
2	B004K4RY9M	This is a good self challenge game. Each time the words get longer and more complex. Searching keeps your mind very busy.
3	B004K4RY9M	I can kill some time with this app. I love it. challenging and fun. Great entertainment for a child that can read but doesn't want to read.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this game! Its so easy to understand and follow along. Especially if you're like me that takes forever to catch on to how to play games. And what I love the most about it is that its free on the kindle fire!
3	B004K4RY9M	Whenever I have some time, I am playing with this game. Excellent visual game and enjoyable to play. Thank you.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have worked Word Search Puzzles for years and years.  I havealways loved to do that for a past time.  Now that I can getit on kindle, I can do word search were ever I am.  Which Ithink is great.
3	B004K4RY9M	Another word game for me to enjoy during my lunch break.  Word games are my delight....not a cross word fan at all.Given the opportunity I would spend a lot more time doing this and Scrabble.  Thanks
3	B004K4RY9M	I do enjoy looking up the words. I have always enjoyed wordsearch. I would recommend this game to anyone. Fun and interesting.
3	B004K4RY9M	it is fun, it is challaging, easy for travel,love the fact that it times you, with out timing out and it saves so much not using paper books. Makes me want to continue to keep playing
3	B004K4RY9M	PLAY IT TO KEEP YOUR MIND ALERT AND FUNCTIONING. WHAT A WAY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR GRANDCHILDREN OR CHILDREN.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very much enjoy this game- have enjoyed it tremendously.  One of my favorites to play in &#34;me&#34; time- now in a portable!
3	B004K4RY9M	We love it! me an my grandkids take turns finding words an connecting the letters....it's great fun an easy to work with....
3	B004K4RY9M	Game starts the player out with very easy hidden words, but increases the length and difficulty as the player continues. Trying to improve the score and beat the clock keeps the player interested.
3	B004K4RY9M	It's a good game to take to an appointmentwhere you have to wait a while until your name iscalled, or to waste some time. I recommend it.
3	B004K4RY9M	This has been really enjoyable, I can do them in a few minutes and then get back to work. It is a stress breaker for me easy, fast and no stress.
2	B004K4RY9M	I was hoping for a more challenging type of game. But this one is good for basic word searches. Fun.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like the challenge it makes my brain work.  I have always liked word games and these are a lot of fun
3	B004K4RY9M	This one is fun but it would be nice to be able to show your best times and be able to reset your best times. After a while you never can beat your best times unless you get an easy puzzle or just happen to have a good day.
2	B004K4RY9M	I just had a hard time swiping the words.  I found it rather boring for me.  Nothing wrong with the app.
3	B004K4RY9M	Puzzles are just hard enough to make you &#34;look&#34;. Use  these puzzles to pass the time during a long car ride.
3	B004K4RY9M	I gave this five stars, as it fits the bill for a quick brain game any time.  I've been home for two months with a painful disability.  I've been immobile and sleeping a lot from pain medication.  I've been reading books on my Kindle Fire, and have become very familiar with classic movies on TCM. I was watching a movie last night, with the Kindle on a TV tray, when it occurred to me I can play the game, watch the movie, and be still enough to use the Tens Unit or heating pad at the same time. The game is fun, totally free, and I can see myself using this for years to come.  I considered my Kindle 2 the best and favorite gift I ever gave myself.  The Kindle Fire is a birthday gift, and it is my new favorite, because I can not only read, but have access to the internet, as well as play word games like this.  I've taken my Kindle 2 everywhere (doctor, dentist, car repair, and to work to read during lunch), and have always taken great precautions to avoid losing it or having it stolen.  I got the Fire shortly after my accident, so it hasn't been out of the house yet.  I imagine I will be too paranoid to risk taking it to work, and will probably take the Kindle 2, but for other idle/waiting situations, I will take the Fire and have a choice of reading, the word games, or internet browsing.  I would recommend this game for anyone who wants to add yet another positive to the Kindle Fire experience.  A big thank you to Amazon for always having the best selection of products for the best prices.
3	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded this app on my Samsung Galaxy III cellphone.  It is so much fun, especially when you're waiting on a doctor's appointment.  I get engaged in finding the words and the time passes by so fast!
3	B004K4RY9M	I've always liked word search puzzles, and this one suits my needs.  Easy to play.  Works well.  No problems with it.
3	B004K4RY9M	It provides hours of fun. It is also great for young children and at the same time challenging for adults.Satisfying!! Thanks to the developers of the Apps and providing it for free.Many thanks, Amazon, you are GREAT for
2	B004K4RY9M	this a cute word search for those who want something to do for a few minutes. but the words to search are repetitive and become boring game after game in this limitless word search.
3	B004K4RY9M	I especially love the customizable backgrounds. When I'm just killing time while my husband is busy, I have a big picture of us kissing right in front of me while I play :)
2	B004K4RY9M	I really like word seaches but this one is kind of blah. To start with the &#34;search&#34; itself is off-center on the screen which puts up in the title making it uncomfortable viewing. Theres no options and the font is annoying. Its very very basic ...just nothing special. I really like &#34;word search fun&#34; game app. instead of this one.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is a good game, but I personally find the puzzles too easy. I would rather have more challenging puzzles. It is a good game for children or anyone just wanting to do some easy puzzles.
3	B004K4RY9M	No pencils required. Easy access and good activity tor. brain and eyesI like the hints idea and scoring rates.
3	B004K4RY9M	Great game to keep your mind alert. A little hard to play with just the finger but my stylus pen should arrive soon and I hope to play the game more often.
3	B004K4RY9M	This app is so much fun. I love word search and this is the best one I have found. I highly recommend getting this app.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy doing puzzles and I have not used this much but I do like it very fun to sit and do puzzles
3	B004K4RY9M	overall this is a good app. its free and it does what it says.helps to pass time.works great on the kindle fire
3	B004K4RY9M	I like it however I wish that there was some way to start a new game from the rankings screen instead of always having to go back to the beginning screen, also wish there were levels of advancement that got harder the more you played. Overall its good and its free, but not great.
3	B004K4RY9M	Great app I love word searches, but for those who don't know how to access the settings hit the. ^ button at the bottom of your kindle then hit the settings you should see it. Great fun app.
3	B004K4RY9M	my son and I love word searches.  He loves doing this when he is bored at the house. great app.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a great game for a free app, cute backgrounds & easy to navigatewould recommend this if you like word search
3	B004K4RY9M	I hate crossword pusels so i dont even know why i donwloaded this i must of been realy bored. but it look great and it didnt take up much room eather.
2	B004K4RY9M	Very easy game to play but wish it was more challenging and also does not fit on the screen of my Kindle Fire right
3	B004K4RY9M	I'm a big fan of word searches, and this is just the right app for me! the only down side is that its only 8 words per word search.
3	B004K4RY9M	OK it works and is simple to use but it lacks the desire to continue on and on. not that complicated but for kids it may be work. (I'm thinking not).
3	B004K4RY9M	I play it all the time and have ordered a stylus pen to use when playing this game as it is hard sometimes when you are using your finger.
3	B004K4RY9M	It has that nice chime sound when a word is finished. You'll enjoy this game and it has a list of subjects to play from.
3	B004K4RY9M	I use it for a time filler. It should rate you against other players. It should keep your best scores, and replace them when you do better.
3	B004K4RY9M	What's the difference between this &quot;free&quot; version and the paid? From the description of the paid one I'm not getting anything more than what I've gotten here which as stated also has an unlimited # of puzzles. So can someone tell me why I should buy the other when this appears to do the same thing?Will post this same comment on the paid version in the hopes of clarification on one of the reviews.
2	B004K4RY9M	Not very difficult so if you like easy puzzles it would be great. I am looking for more complicated puzzles for me
3	B004K4RY9M	u guys have to get this app it is the best app u could ever think of in the universe
3	B004K4RY9M	fun simple game for any age group; good game for all who like a challenge. try it; you'll like it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Sort of hard to do with your finger, I assume it will be much easier when I get a StyllisI have always enjoyed this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	This app helps you develop and strengthen your ability to find word puzzle answers. It is a good way to release the tension people often experience in their daily work activities. I like it and would encourage others to try it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I loved this game!  Not only is the interface well designed, but the game play is fun.  I found myself desperately trying to beat my own times.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes puzzles in general, and I would defnitely say that is a game to satisfy any word seek fanatics out there.
3	B004K4RY9M	Reasonably straight forward to use.  A real mind focusing game,  Keeps me quiet for hours at a time.  Fun Game.
2	B004K4RY9M	Word Search. Another freebie that stays mostly in my cloud. It's okay for what it does, but its nothing to rave about.
3	B004K4RY9M	For the price offered, this game is fun and addicting. The quantity of words available for selection for each game is a little low for my personal liking but I enjoy it.
2	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded this app and played it a few times. I really haven't played it much since I downloaded it. Gets boring after a while.
3	B004K4RY9M	I bought this game to keep busy on a long flight and I keep finding myself trying to beat my score :)
3	B004K4RY9M	Really enjoy this app, my son enjoys competeing against himself to get a better time and enjoys competeing against his mom
3	B004K4RY9M	Ever since I was a little girl, pretty much as soon as I could read the words well enough to solve a word search I've been in love w/ word searches, and I LOVE this app. I do wish we had different &#34;levels&#34; to choose from w/ varying lengths of word banks, but 8 words is easy enough when you're being timed. It's fun to try and beat my scores on my scoreboard.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a great game. i love playing it the smalllest words are the hardest to find. i am so happy they had it so i could download it to my kindle fire
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy this game and I like that it's on my Kindle and I don't have to carry a book around.These type of games help me to keep my observation skills honed.  It's addicting!
3	B004K4RY9M	cant say anything bad about this game, keeps me busy and helps me to unwind when trying to get ready for bedtime
3	B004K4RY9M	I've loved word searches since I was a child and read Highlights magazines.  It took a minute or two to figure how to work it but it looks and works fine.  I think my husband, daughter and myself will like it and find it challenging.
3	B004K4RY9M	many puzzles to solve. Love word searches this is the game you want. easy to solve and fun.For anyone who enjoys puzzles.
3	B004K4RY9M	THIS WORD SEARCH IS CHALLENGING & KEEPS MY MIND ACTIVE.  I AM 65 YEARS OLD & MEMORY GETS HARDER TO HOLD ON TO AT TIMES SO THIS PROGRAM IS HELPING ME!  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
2	B004K4RY9M	The game is ok but it's either my technique or kindle, but I have to repeatedly swipe the word for it to recognize that I've swiped it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Besides keeping me up on my word-finding skills, it is helping me build skill with finger use for my new Kindle.  Gotta swipe just the right letters in just the right order.  Good for a quick two-minute filler.  Fun, easy and very addictive.  A definite yes on my list of games.
3	B004K4RY9M	Pretty easy, but a great way to spend a few minutes, if you can stop at a few minutes. Slightly addictive.
3	B004K4RY9M	Excellent word game, great for playing when you arewaiting for an appointment some place.  I play it almostdaily.
1	B004K4RY9M	I tried this work search and I didn't like it there was a better one I found for the Kindle that I like alot more.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like this game. I play it as often as I can to help calm my nerves.  It's very relaxing.
2	B004K4RY9M	ok! something you would do as a quickie games. too short, not enough involvment. don't remember if i paid or not, but would not pay again.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is the best one I have ever found. It keeps me intertained forhours. Love to play at night while watching reruns on Tv.
3	B004K4RY9M	Sometimes when playing this game it is hard to find some words. And then again wome of the words just stick right out at you.  Awesome.
3	B004K4RY9M	grew up on wordsearch. still enjoy it, i find it relaxing and fun to do. no challenge, just easy and fun.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game doesn't have enought puzzles in it.  When touched, it is too sensitive and has to be touched a couple of times sometimes and takes up your time.Update:  Now that I have had this game awhile and have learned how to work it, I love it.  Haven't purchase the full game yet, but probably will.
2	B004K4RY9M	What do you expect from a free app? I mean it's not that challenging it runs good, but it gets very boring very quickly...
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy doing word search puzzles and was pleased to find this one.  I like that the list of words is fairly short, so you aren't tied up with one puzzle for long.  The biggest problem I have found is that there are a lot of misspelled words.  So if you don't notice the misspellings, you may not find the words.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a basic word search app. It is quick and something to take you away from stress, even if it is for a few minutes. Keep it simple and enjoy your few minutes of time to yourself.
3	B004K4RY9M	It is really fun. Its not to hard to find the words but its been hard to beat my lowest score that I have though.
1	B004K4RY9M	I tried to play it and it didn't work for me, I am a avid word search person, so with that being said, it was free and I tried it.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great app for those times when you have a few minutes to kill and don't want to get too involved.
2	B004K4RY9M	Although I enjoy playing this Word Search, it is a bit too simple for my taste. For instance, the number of words &#34;searched&#34; for is too short; I think 10 or 12 words would be better. The other thing is that in some categories, the same words are used in different puzzles over and over. That takes much of the fun out of it. An overhaul may be necessary to increase the difficulty of this puzzle, in my opinion.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun game for those who enjoy word search games. I would recomment it to anyone. I love playing it.
3	B004K4RY9M	like it
3	B004K4RY9M	Excellent word search app.  So many puzzles/searches to choose from.  You are timed and the app keeps track of the top best times.  Highly recommended.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you love word find books, you'll love this one.  Easy to use and don't require a pen.  I love it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like this game and so does my husband.  It's not real hard and it's small so it doesn't take all day to play.  I would recommend this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	sometimes the &#34;highlighting&#34; of the word is a little annoying, but overall, I like this game. I wish the words were in alphabetical order, that would help.
2	B004K4RY9M	I like it  and enjoy the words that come up in the puzzle.  Much easier to keep track rather than with a paper and pencil.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love games that are just for passing the time, when your at the doctor, at the airport or on your lunchbreak. This one is as challenging as you want it to be. You pick easy, normal or hard. The harder the level the more words to find. This is very addictive and is a fun game for everyone. I definately recommend this app for anyone. Oh, btw, word searches are also great exercises for your eyes!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun for those that like word searches. It's simple and easy to use and doesn't take long. Good for a stress break.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is quick game and I can play it on my lunch hour.  It would be better if you had more words to search for.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like word finds.  This one it easy to see on my kindle.  My daughter has fun with it also.  I love having this at my finger tips if I need something to do.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy this free game. I just wish it had more words each time. It really makes a person think.
2	B004K4RY9M	I don't like having a timer running. I use part of the time just reading the words I need to look for.Sometimes the words jump right out and other times you can look at it and not find all of them.The level is fine.  Sometimes it takes  3-4 tries to get the diagonal words hi-lighted.....which uses uptime.....
3	B004K4RY9M	I got this since it was free and I was bored. Nothing like doing word searches when your bored in a car ride going somewhere over an hour away.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very easy to play. Works well with the stylus. I like the fact that it was free. Glad I chose it.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great game and lots of fun.  I rated it 4 out of 5 because, I don't have a stylus yet for playing the game and it doesn't register that I found a word when I have to use my fingers.  Otherwise it's great.  I'm getting a stylus (I think that's what it's called) and a cover soon.  Should solve the minor problem.  Good game.  Good fun/
3	B004K4RY9M	Great game.  It is a little difficult to select the word once you find it but other than that this a great game.  Makes you stop and think.  Get to work your mind a little bit.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have some trouble dragging the line through the letters with my fingers and have to try several times to define the word.  That is probably my own shortcoming, not the game.
2	B004K4RY9M	Would be nice if it had more words to search for, or different difficulty levels.  Bit too easy for me.
3	B004K4RY9M	i can spend all day on that finding words and timing myself how fast you can find the words sometimes pretty quick
3	B004K4RY9M	Like the variety of words and combinations.Keeps my mind busy.I like to do this when my mind is full of other distractions.Recommend to anyone.
3	B004K4RY9M	I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves wordsearch games. I can't stop playing this game. Just give it a try and see for yourself.
3	B004K4RY9M	This really helps to pass the time while you are waiting on the doctor.  My husband always has purchased word search books but now he really likes the timed portion of this.  Thank you.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like circle words you'll love this. I like to use it just before bed, in bed. Don't have to worry about making sure there's a pen or pencil within reach.
1	B004K4RY9M	I usually love word games, but when I was playing this, I felt like I was playing a game that was meant for second graders.Deleted it off my kindle after playing two games.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like to keep my word skills sharp, to avoid looking like an illiterate moron online. This is definitely a good program!
3	B004K4RY9M	Nice e-version of the printed puzzles.  The smaller words are the harder to find, since larger words can only fit in so many places...
3	B004K4RY9M	I love the word search app!!  It is very fun and time goes by fast when I play it I would recommend it to people who like word searches.
3	B004K4RY9M	I think this is one of the better word search apps you can get for your kindle fire HD. It's a fun and easy game and great app.
2	B004K4RY9M	The first line of letters are on the colored frame of the blackboard, making them almost impossible to see.  It can be difficult for the program to take the finger pressure without skipping or starting and stopping in unintentional places.  It ended up being more frustrating than enjoyable.
1	B004K4RY9M	The upper two or three rows of the letter box are buried in the top banner and unreadable.  The letter box is squeezed in the top third of the screen.  This is unusable.
3	B004K4RY9M	what more can be said download it play it, if you don't like it erase it (got to love free things)
3	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded this for my Android device and have really enjoyed it.  It keeps track of my times so I constantly play against myself.  I recommend.
2	B004K4RY9M	Words are sometimes hard to see.  There is a pattern on where the words are hidden, after a few times of play you'll quickly pick up where they hide words.  Font is hard to see.  Sometimes the words are off where the grid should be.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is a moderately good WordSearch game but it isn't themed by board, the words are not in alphabetical order and the font used on the grid is horrible.Each grid pegs you against the clock which is okay but not critical. It just means that you have to click out of the 'leader board', back to the puzzle, and the click on new to get another grid.So overall, it's okay but not great.
3	B004K4RY9M	I loved wors search games as a kid - and now to have it on my kindle is even better...  helps keep my mind sharp..
3	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy word searches a whole lot, so this was a great app for me! I recamend it to others who love word searches so that you can see how entertaining this Cool thing is!
3	B004K4RY9M	Got this one for the XYL.  She loves it.  The interface is very easy to use and some of the puzzles can be challenging
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is fun but it is a little too easy. It would be better if you could change levels some how.
1	B004K4RY9M	I like word searches but this one is too simple and boring for me to get any enjoyment out of it.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearch Unlimited Free game for android is a good game. It works pretty well. I like word searches so the game is what I was looking for. The look is simple and the image is clear so the layout of the game is good.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like wordsearch games.  This one works pretty well on the Kindle Fire HD.  Sometimes it does not readily recognize your correct selection and you have to redo it.
2	B004K4RY9M	I love most word search type games free or not, however the problem with this particular one is that the first line of letters is on the top of the chalk board so very hard to see and there are only 8 words to find. That is not really much of a challenge.
3	B004K4RY9M	I originally got this app for my dad when we were traveling and he loved playing it and still.plays it!!
3	B004K4RY9M	I really really really like the that I can tap the first letter in a word then tap the last letter and it selects the whole word.  great design feature.
2	B004K4RY9M	These are simple and quick, great for when you just have a few minutes before work or waiting at the doctor's office.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this little app , yes the word lists are short, but the timer makes it so much more entertaing than some other searches I have tried. My husband and I like to vie for the top spots.
3	B004K4RY9M	Interesting word lists. Clear and easy to read puzzle. Easy to circle the words, unlike other puzzles where you have to try several times to get it to hold the circled word. It is set up like the typical Search A Word, where the larger words are found around the frame of the puzzle and one or two words running diagonal in the middle. I found some of the shorter words actually to be the hardest to find. I like where you can pick up where you left off. Very good especially for free. No annoying ads or pop-ups.
3	B004K4RY9M	it is really good for your brain :-) and it can helpless you learn new words and it helps you find long words
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great word search game.  Give it a try and you will love it too.  I like the game very much.  Thanks,
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like word searches, you will like this game.  It is not super challenging but it is a fun game to have on your device.  I recommend it to have.
2	B004K4RY9M	I find I really enjoy this game more when I have paper and pencil available. It just does't have the appeal of the real game.
3	B004K4RY9M	This WordSearch is so much fun. I enjoy playing this on my kindle at least once a day and challenge myself to go faster
1	B004K4RY9M	I did not enjoy this word search at all. They only include about 8 words in their list. It offered no challenge for me and therefore proved to be very boring.  I actually deleted it from my kindle.Knight68
2	B004K4RY9M	I love word searches but found that this one is great at first but tends to get boring once you play it a few times. Not one of the better word searches available.
3	B004K4RY9M	thanks. its simple and fun. given me the power over many options thanks. I have some ideas to make it even better; overall its a great game.
3	B004K4RY9M	really fun game and so easy to do. glad there are free games to play . it would cost a fortune if you had to buy everthing
1	B004K4RY9M	You have a little time to waste, give this a try.  It almost seems too easy.  Not something I feel compelled to play.
2	B004K4RY9M	Word Serach Unlimited Free is fun.  But not as challenging as I thought it would be.  But it is still a good game if you like word search puzzles.
1	B004K4RY9M	Its good but maybe I'm looking for more of a challenge. I don't know exactly what it is missing but it is a little bland.
1	B004K4RY9M	The app gives you like 8 words at a time in a small area of words which makes it really easy. There are no levels.  I would personally download something else if you want a word search.
3	B004K4RY9M	keeps you entertained more than a few minutes. once you do a few you get on a roll. easy fun.
3	B004K4RY9M	The interface is intuitive and easy to use and the program provides exactly what it says - unlimited wordsearches (I'm guessing just a massive list of words that it can assemble either via similarity or at random).
3	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded this for my Fire and really enjoy the word searches. Its simple enough that my six year old can play. I don't have a problem with the words sex or hell coming up in a search, but then again don't recall seeing them, either. I will admit that sometimes the sensitivity to register a word is lacking, but all in all it runs smoothly.
2	B004K4RY9M	This free Word Search game is fine, but the words are not connected in any way. Every word search is just a hodgepodge of easy, everyday words to strange, uncommon words. It would be nice if it had different themes that could be chosen, like words related to &#34;camping&#34;, &#34;cooking&#34;, &#34;outer space&#34;, etc. and a better mix of words. I guess I was expecting it to be more like the word searches I have bought in the past. I realize it's free, but I would like to see a better word mix than ; NAP, IMPOTENCE, PARTNER.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a fun game you can do puzzes and it keeps you challenged.  I like it becasue it makes you work hard to find the word.
1	B004K4RY9M	do not download when you find the words does not give you credit there's words in there that are not even in the dictionary ad I challenged a few of the words if I could I wouldn't even give it one star
3	B004K4RY9M	I like doing word search, and this app fulfills my needs. I Love it!!! Give it a try if you enjoy word search! :)
3	B004K4RY9M	I play it occasionally when I have down time. The graphics are good and it is a good addition to my game app collection.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is fun and a mind relaxer while waitng in the doctors office.  I love it.  I am getting better at it
3	B004K4RY9M	Great game excellent when your traveling and needs to kill time. It keep you busy since it is easy to move from one game to the next.
2	B004K4RY9M	Good game to keep your eyes & mind working.  I usually do not like wordsearch games but this was fun.
2	B004K4RY9M	It's pretty fun after all. I don't play it every day but it's ok when I'm bored to tears!! Enjoy!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a pretty good word search game, and it's free! I like that you can change the background. It will also keep track of how quickly you complete a puzzle, which I kind of like.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy this free version because it introduced me to several thins I take for granted in any environment. The ability to search for a word, using sight, patterns and recognition is truly amazing and this very simple wordsearch game does it very effectively. I was an avide crossword puzzle addict in my younger years. The NYTimes Sunday crossword puzzle was my ultimate challenge every weekend. But as life would have it, reality set in; first, the job; then the family; then a child; unlimited time; then not enough time; Things have come full circle and now I find that I actually make time to do things I like to do; crossword puzzles is now a part of that and while some may see this particular game as a simple one, what I found amazing was that when I was using it the other day, my three-year grandson became enthralled by the search and was able to identify the simple words presented; he actuallyidentified words he knew; more importantly, he was paying attention to the patterns and where to look. Awesome, simply awesome for something so basic.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game alot. You can change your word list and backgrounds for a different look.It is fun to play.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is a word search game.  Sometimes the letters are hard to select but that usually means I need to clean my screen.  I got the game for free for my Fire and have had no problems.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like to do word searches and this is a fun one to have. I have big figures so sometime it is hard to do the words but still really like it. I have learned to work around it.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearch Unlimited Free is a fun game.  It challenges you, but does not frustrate.  I no longer have to buy word search books to use before going to bed.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearchThis was also  free  and It was another game I enjoyed playing on the bus trip and it was very interested
3	B004K4RY9M	I like trying to beat my own score. This is great when you are bored or waiting to play a couple quick games to pass the time.
3	B004K4RY9M	I purchased this for the Grand Kids and they have played it a few times and really enjoy the game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy the Wordsearch unlimited free app and use it every day.  It keeps your mind young and alert.  I highly recommend this app.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like word search games and the thought of one on my Kindle Fire was, well kinda cool!  I like being able to play it as often as I like, over and over again.
2	B004K4RY9M	I love word games and amoung them word search; however, word list is limited.  Don't mind the time challenge though.  When purchasing games was looking for word games/
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a very good game I would recommend it to anyone and very easy to use.  Only wish the letters were more clear
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this game giving it a 5star well worth downloading in the setting you a choicebig letters or small letters wonderful app it's a must download..
2	B004K4RY9M	Time is okay & puzzles are good, but I must press very hard with my stylus to play the game.
3	B004K4RY9M	It does not require to search for many words which I thought you would have, but its good down time!
3	B004K4RY9M	This is an easy task to perform when you want to play something but you don't want to think to hard.  It's a fun mental exercise.
3	B004K4RY9M	Keep your brain young & healthy with something so simple. I truely believe, based on own experiences that if we just sit aroundd watching Tv our brains will suffer...memory issues, difficulty concentrating,  mind &#34;going blank &#34; mid-sentence, etc..& no I don't think word searches will fix all of that but it does help!! Puzzles r simple but do engage your mind power to some degree. It was free!! Would recommend at that price to any age person (well not a baby....lol) .
3	B004K4RY9M	I think this game helps to keep your mind sharp and enjoy playing it in the evening. My daughter likes it too
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search games, and this one is fun and addicting.  It is a great way to pass the time.
3	B004K4RY9M	Even though I really like this game I think it could be just a little more challenging or have different levels.
3	B004K4RY9M	Great to kill time and to learn how to spell.  Wonder for my kid to play because of its educational value.
3	B004K4RY9M	awesome game! I really love this game. you get timed to get the words listed and everytime I tried to do it faster.
3	B004K4RY9M	It was interest & fun but it need alot more to it. Would recommed it to my friend but still need to add alot longer searchs
2	B004K4RY9M	I will do word search. Its too easy for me and I kinda like to be challenged. It's okay anyway.
3	B004K4RY9M	THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO LEARN WORDS, OLD ONES AND NEW ONES AND GET TO THEM BEFORE YOU RUN OUT OF TIME..I STRONGLY RECCOMMEND IT FOR ADULTS AS WELL AS KIDS ABLE TO READ ...ITS A GOOD CHALLENGE AND BRAIN FUNCTION WORD GAME..
3	B004K4RY9M	I really don't use this very often... but every once in awhile I turn it on for a simple, pleasant, easy app to waste a little time.
3	B004K4RY9M	Easy to use! You can highlight each word forward or backwards for speed. Each game encourages you to sole it quickly.
3	B004K4RY9M	very good to keep your mind fresh.keeps you always thinking and it is fun to be stumped on a word
3	B004K4RY9M	You have to shake out the old cob webs and does not discriminate against age.  Very good game for all.
2	B004K4RY9M	I'm not a big word search fan, but I downloaded it to occupy my mind when I get bored. It was alright, but nothing to write home about.
2	B004K4RY9M	does't offer enough words in one puzzle, need more words to search for. other wise it is a fun game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always had such fun with search-a-word.  Game keeps up with the time it take to get all words however you can take your time.  Good game to pass the time away when you have a few minutes to spare.
3	B004K4RY9M	I loved the word search game because I like word search games.  I would recommend this game for people who like word search games.
1	B004K4RY9M	It down loaded to my pad no bigger than the size of my phone, could be operator error :)  You can't change the font, difficult to capture the letters and pick the words.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word searches. I find that this one is one of the better ones. You can choose the difficulty which is awesome!
2	B004K4RY9M	Fun to play on a nice afternoon.  Not very challenging which is great and a great way to occupy kids and older adults.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word games of any kind & this one pass' the test..I find myself sitting forever passing the time away!
2	B004K4RY9M	it good for free. I wouldn't buy this though.  its a fun game. not super challenging though.  nice graphics and works great on a touch screen.
3	B004K4RY9M	Great time waster.  It's just like having a book of find-a-word but without having to find a pen or pencil.
3	B004K4RY9M	didnt even use the free one. WENT STRAIGHT TO THE UPGRADE!!Hours of ,fun for friends when they come to visit, or kids hanging out.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always enjoyed working a good word search game. Now my daughter has gotten into word search. Good for you.
3	B004K4RY9M	well I love this app is ease for any age to use I even have my mom loving it that she learn how to use my kindle fire :D
3	B004K4RY9M	I know, how lame to love a word search, but I do! It's not one of those giant word searches with 600 words to find, I believe it gives you eight. And they go from three letter words to words clear across the whole board, and words you wouldn't expect to find in a word search app. I love this game.
2	B004K4RY9M	A lot of these are too simple and right there in your face. It would be better if the set was bigger, had more letters, and more difficult words to find. I would recommend this to a 4th to 7th grade student for fun, easy after school game play. Very nice game otherwise.
1	B004K4RY9M	DO NOT buy! Couldn't play game on fire. Everytime you would hit play nothing but ads would pop up. Game would not start after that. No wonder it was free.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always loved Word Search puzzles and now I can try it on my Kindle Fire.  It is fun and keeps me entertained.
3	B004K4RY9M	fun during a long car ride kept kids and myself occu[pied fa lal la lal lal lal a;la lal lal
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search. It is the only type of real challenge I enjoy...I'm not much of a competitor but I enjoy the game itself.
3	B004K4RY9M	This program makes the time fly by. Even my husband likes to play it. Easy to work the program too
2	B004K4RY9M	kinda boreing and loss intrest quickly and i guess it is cause the screen is small the puzzle seem easy
3	B004K4RY9M	I choose this word search because it was challenging.  It also gives you the time it took to find all the words.  Keeps the mind alert.  Recommend it to all ages.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love that you can select your level of difficulty. I have not attempted the extreme, as scrolling from page to page is not something I am willing to attempt.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very good game, like the fact it times you on how long you take to finish the puzzle, you must try it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I became addicted to this game years ago while I sat in the waiting room at the Pediatrician's Office. I'll be dating myself when I ask, do those of you who are parents remember the Highlights Magazine? It was the only thing that made the very long wait bearable. That and a sick child who needed medication or just relief finding out it was nothing to worry about.Well this is so very much better! No one else has filled it in already and there are no sick children. The game lets you choose which level you want. It times how long it takes to complete each game. It also gives you a percentage of how you're doing. If you're competitive at all, you'll have fun just competing with yourself!The game automatically keeps track of your time and scores for each game. If you want to, you can ask for a hint and you'll be given one. I haven't done so yet and I've been playing the game for 3 hours straight.It's a fun way to stimulate your brain, pass the time and play! And it's free!Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. :)Bes
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game very much and would recommended to anyone. It is easy to play and keeps mind busy thinking.
3	B004K4RY9M	I don't play every day and its therapy in helping me focus . Can you add the option to play with others?
3	B004K4RY9M	I Like to search for words. I enjoy it - wish it had larger words to look for - should be more challenging.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love the game. Especially because it is unlimited. I enjoy playing many games in a row. It might be more fun if I could play against someone.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love these word search games, however this one is kind of blah. The color is to dull but like it because it is free.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is fun, but there could be a few more words per puzzle and if you don't touch the word exactly you have to start over.
2	B004K4RY9M	I love word searches, and was excited when I found this. However the words are super easy to find, not to mention that there are only a few to look-up on each search. I do like the timing feature, but it isn't enough to earn a better rating from me.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love word search games and this was free and I can take it with me on my Kindle Fire to anywhere. Only thing with free games is you have pop up ads that are sometimes annoying.
2	B004K4RY9M	Pretty good but limited, also not too many options to change and type font is difficult for someone with poor eyesight.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you enjoy word search games, you'll like this.  It does just what it should.  You can choose different pages.
3	B004K4RY9M	I used this game last night--The only thing I did not like I found the words but I could not get it to accept the words so it looked like it took me a long time to play the words
3	B004K4RY9M	This is great app  My wife loves word search puzzles,  I downloaded it for her to use while sitting at home  or traveling
3	B004K4RY9M	I like word searches and this on is okay the graphics could be better. Also sometimes you have to do it a few times for it to accept what you are entering or swiping. Still it's one to help pass the time.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this game. It is fast paced and anyone can play. We have contests to see who can get the best score (time). Great fun.
3	B004K4RY9M	Out of the three word searches ive seen,  this is the one I actually use. I like the backgrounds, I like the way its like a real search, and most of the words are good. There are some English (Uk English)  spelled words, but that's ok. It still has all the fun of a regular search :)
3	B004K4RY9M	Don't listen to those with bad reviews this game is amazingly awesome, seriously fun and entertaining. It is great for down time and is enjoyable this is an absolute gotta have. No kidding!!!!! Listen to me please, this a gotta have!!!!!!!!:):):) the developer of this game is great with coming up with everything on this game. Thankyou so much to whoever made this game, I really love it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Have only used this app a few time but it did pass the time.  Going on vacation so we&#34;ll see house it works.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is ok for quick word search games. You only get 8 words to search for which makes this one easy to master. With this in mind, it's not the best word search but is great for passing a few minutes before getting back to work from breaks and lunches.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is fun and works perfectly. I enjoy the puzzles, they keep my brain working and are enjoyable, I have not gotten real far in the game, however I am hoping as it progresses it gets harder.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love playing WordSearch on my KindleFire. I have always loved tofind words scrambled throughout letters.  I would recommend this toanyone who enjoys the same!
3	B004K4RY9M	i love word search i always have i bought books thru the years, sometimes i can solve them really fast
3	B004K4RY9M	I usually like to do word search when I don't want to do a lot of thinking.  It is something I do when I want to do some down time.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game app, but would like it to be a little harder to do. Maybe I just didn't continue on to higher level.
3	B004K4RY9M	A puzzle that is great fun yet light to play; doesn't demand too much effort, which makes it relaxing to play.  I am so glad I have this game on my Kindle Fire. Love it!
2	B004K4RY9M	This too is an OK set, but sometimes I think they make up the words, but it's doable, just not great
2	B004K4RY9M	This is exactly like a word seach but I deleted it because the line you draw to connect the letters keeps jumping off the letter you want making it difficult to complete your search. I did one word 4 times and it would never 'take' so I ended up deleting it.
2	B004K4RY9M	Not many words on each puzzle.  Nothing new or interesting here.  If you enjoy word search puzzles, you will enjoy thi.
3	B004K4RY9M	I LOVE THIS GAME BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIND THE WORDS IN A LIMITED AMOUT OF TIME AND IT MAKES ME THINK THE WHOLE TIME.  IT HAS MADE MY MIND A LITTLE SHARPER AND DETERMINED TO BEAT THE TIME ALLOWED. SO FAR SO GOOD.  A GREAT FLIGHT OCCUPIER.
3	B004K4RY9M	Challenge to race against time to find all the words. Keeps the brain working. Would recommend to people who like keeping the brain stimulated.
1	B004K4RY9M	Does not work on my kindle fire.  I opened it up and it crashed, I reinstalled it, and it crashed again.
1	B004K4RY9M	Total waste of time. Horrible interface, poor gameplay and words. Avoid at all costs, even free. Word selection interface is horrible. Nothing redeemable about this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I ENJOYED THE CHALLENGE, WOULD RECOMMEND  THIS TO ALL AGES AND VERY GOOD FOR SENIOR CITIZENS WHO SHOULD BE CHALLENGING THEIR BRAIN POWER.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very fun game, only one thing wrong with it.  Sometimes you cannot get the line to stick on the word.  Otherwise I would recommend it as I love it.
3	B004K4RY9M	it's alright to do when I'm bored.  I haven't been in the word search habit but when I get into it, I sometimes don't want to quit.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love search a word and I am so glad I can get it on my Kindle Fire now I can enjoy it, so if you like search a word like I do get it, so much fun.
2	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy word search puzzles but I was a little disappointed with this one because there are such few words to find and it's not as challenging as I hoped but still good to help pass the time at the doctors office or in any waiting room.
3	B004K4RY9M	Easy and fun. I like to challenge my speed by submitting after each game. Note: Don't drag across the full word - tap the beginning/ending letters, it will automatically highlight the word. This also increases your speed.
1	B004K4RY9M	Did not care for this game.  Did not find any part of it to hold my interest. Do not recommend to or for anyone.
1	B004K4RY9M	Would be better if the letters were a tad larger. Found that the game would not respond on occasion. Was no way to complete the game because of this.
3	B004K4RY9M	Fun, entertaining, somewhat educational.  Easy to play, I also like that it gives you the option to add your score.
2	B004K4RY9M	There are short lists. I don't like that is timed.  There may be a casual setting but I have not looked at this point.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like word-search is a very good game to have on kindle, and no paper or pens to worry about.
3	B004K4RY9M	Not bad.  Once you get the hang of it, it's a pretty neat game.  I like playing with words anyway, so this game entertains me.
3	B004K4RY9M	Ok this game started out horrible because I didn't know how to use it &quot;Like any other game&quot; but then I learned that in life you cant always get what you want so make the best out of life.
2	B004K4RY9M	WordSearch Unlimited Free WordSearch Unlimited Free WordSearch Unlimited Free WordSearch Unlimited Free WordSearch Unlimited Free WordSearch t was free that is all I can say
1	B004K4RY9M	The programmers done more attention to aesthetic than at the game.I've seen better programs about.Further versions perhaps can merge a good aesthetic of the game to more funcionality. :)
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game because it's easy and now I don't have to buy the booklet.  Couldn't find the instructions on how to play and took awhile to figure out line must change color to take off list.
3	B004K4RY9M	great for when you have to wait on someone that is seeing the doctor or dentist gust flif this game out and play and it also works for a child 10 and up
1	B004K4RY9M	Really enjoyed this on Kindle Fire HD but on Fire HDX the top row of letters disappears into the header. Needs to be updated for new Kindle version.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love solving these kind of puzzles.  It keeps my brain in working order.  I like the challenge in figuring where the words are and finding them.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like word search, this is a nice app. I would rather have something that isn't timed and more challenging, but it is a nice app. I would like to have more variety of subjects. Maybe something more relevant and less generic.
3	B004K4RY9M	Got this as a Gift Item for my son on his Kindle Fire. His sister picked this out to put on it. Downloaded easy and works good.
1	B004K4RY9M	This game is just too simple. The graphics are nice, gameplay is user friendly, but it takes less than 2 minutes to complete a game.
2	B004K4RY9M	I like it but don't play it often. I am not sure what I don't like about it but there you have it.
3	B004K4RY9M	i enjoy this fast paced game. I try to find the words as fast as possible. I gives my eyes and brain a good work out sometimes.
3	B004K4RY9M	I got this one for myself and I play it for some down time. I'm glad I got this one !
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game, it keeps you looking for the word and finding others at the same time. Not to hard.
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is so much fun I literaly played it for over two an a half hours. plus its educational.  very good for the brain. I think that every. kid and adult should get it. people would have gigantic brains if they got this. two words .... love it!
3	B004K4RY9M	Finding the words isn't the problem. The real hard part of this game is beating your's and other people's records. Very amusing and time consuming!
3	B004K4RY9M	Keeps me busy for hours, but drains the battery in my kindle quicker also. Still, a very fun game, makes time go by quickly.
3	B004K4RY9M	I play this one ALOT. I love the challenge. Very stimulating and you feel GREAT when you get to post your speed scores.
3	B004K4RY9M	When I'm up for a challenge..I try to go for the hardest puzzle to go for. It's more fun for me this way. Love how I can change the background, it can give it a different image, pretty fun.
3	B004K4RY9M	Free, can't beat it for the price. Easy paced, great selection of words used, hours of endless fun for all.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is really well done for lovers of search words. Some of the other reviews I read had complained about the bottom of the screen not being visible, but then I realized they were all trying to use it on their small screen phones. Not an issue on a tablet like Kindle Fire which is where it was really meant to be played.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is great but a few times I played,I found that some words will repeat on the same spot on the list,and in the exact same place.Love it but can be glitchy
3	B004K4RY9M	WORD SEARCH UNLIMITED  this is an enjoyable app for relaxation. I am able to use this anywhere that I go!
3	B004K4RY9M	I don't like being timed on this - I just wanted to take my time.  I know it is free but there are really not a lot of words to find.
3	B004K4RY9M	I used this app on my kindle fire. I like that you can draw a line through the words as you find them and that the words and letters are large enough that you don't have to strain to see them. I would highly recommend this app for anyone who loves word searches like I do!
3	B004K4RY9M	There are a lot of different puzzles in this game, game but there aren't very many words in each puzzle. It's ok to pay when you don't have much to do but I really don't play it all that much because  it's just so easy.
3	B004K4RY9M	It is just like the word search in books.....I have enjoyed playing it on my Kindle and it is free.....
3	B004K4RY9M	It is your normal wordsearch app. Works great on my kindle fire. The app needs something to, I don't know, liven it up. Maybe background music or different backgrounds. Besides that it is a great app.
3	B004K4RY9M	I will like Word Search and will like it better when I have time to sit down and play it.
3	B004K4RY9M	A fun game and you can't beat the price.Works great on myAcer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet (Gray).  Easy to use with customizable settings.Nice way to pass some time.  My wife likes to play when she's relaxing.
3	B004K4RY9M	I needed something to challenge me and still was fun. This is just the thing to get a quick game in during commercials.
2	B004K4RY9M	I got this because I thought it would be at least a bit difficult.  I let my 6 yr olds play it now.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this game and can play it for hrs. I like the idea of trying to beat the clock but would probably like it better if it were larger,had more words and was a little more difficult.
2	B004K4RY9M	not as challenganging as it could be needs many more words in each puzzle to search for.more words would make it more challenging
3	B004K4RY9M	It pretty easy to do, but sometimes it hard to press the letter, probably easier with a stylus. It only gives you eight words at a time so that's annoying. I don't like that it gives you a timer because personally I feel like I need to do it fast. So it's good but not quite what I'm looking for.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is an ok game, but wasnt really impressed by it. It doesn't give you many words at one time.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like the game it's challenging and fun. I like the backgrounds you can choose and it's a quick game if you want it to be.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great time waster for my kids while waiting for a table at a restaurant, or while waiting for food at a slow one!  My 7 year old has mastered this, and my 4 year old can find a few words on her own.  Keeps them busy and everyone else happy!
3	B004K4RY9M	ok word search fans throw the paperback books away because this word search is just as fun. It actually challenges you. because you're being timed
3	B004K4RY9M	Works well on Kindle Fire.  A little on the easy side, even on &quot;hard&quot; setting. Perhaps it could allow a larger word array on tablets. I too have trouble within high score retention.  I think the &quot;clear&quot; button is too close to the &quot;show menu&quot; tab at the bottom of the screen. Needs an [x] button to close the score list. I especially like the many word lists. Try a foreign language list, if you want a little more challenge.
2	B004K4RY9M	Mentions elements to game that ends up not being offered on free game, have to upgrade to paid.  Free game is boring. Exactly the same size, same number of words every time.  Not very challanging.
3	B004K4RY9M	Pretty good, although screen does not always respond correctly to the stylus or finger when finding a word. A pretty good time killer when I am waiting somewhere.
2	B004K4RY9M	Not that good and not that bad.  Nothing special.  Somewhat boring.  Something to do when I tire of my other games.
2	B004K4RY9M	Great idea but frustrating. I have very small fingers but it is very hard to get the lines to stop on the correct word so can't imagine trying to use it with average size hands.
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is awesome me and my family challenge eachother all the time its great to do when your bored I think everyone should get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004K4RY9M	Im 10 and I love love love word search puzzles this is a great app its super fun.its a great app for all ages.
1	B004K4RY9M	Not what I was looking for. Decided on a different word search by Random Salad. It has ads, but fits what I wanted better.
3	B004K4RY9M	I am like a 10 year old when it comes to word search...i just love them! I realize there is not much academic challenge to them but who cares. i especially love this app because it challenges you to find the words in a good time. I play this on a daily basis.
1	B004K4RY9M	Ridiculously small and unusable.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is great for a short some thing to do to get your eyes and brain to going. I would suggest you purchase a sytlus, it makes it easier to put the letters together to form the words. I like to get up of a morning and play this while I am having my coffee.I also like the timer. I think you ought to try this game its fun to see how fast you can get and everyone needs alittle brain exersise.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love this!!  Whoever dreams these up is a genius!!!!  Your mind is completely captivated by this.  This keeps your eyes wide open!
3	B004K4RY9M	I love to do word search me and my kids do them all the time love it . It does my mind good thanks
3	B004K4RY9M	I would like to see more words and bigger puzzles.  I had a hard time &#34;circling&#34; the words, but my manager gave me a stylus and it is a breeze now.  Thanks, Judy!
1	B004K4RY9M	This game was way too easy even at the hardest level.  Maybe okay for children. I would not recommend this game for anyone over the age of 4.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a typical word search game but the format is different.  The graphics aren't the same as the description.  It looks like a blackboard with handwritten letters.  The first couple of games I found it off-putting.  The puzzles are easy and start out with only 12  words to find.  I like it when I don't have a lot of time but want to be able to finish a game.
3	B004K4RY9M	Got my Kindle for Christmas and this was my first download. I like that the fonts are adjustable so that I don't always have to wear my glasses. .
3	B004K4RY9M	HA one of my games on my Kindle Fire...It is fun, easy to use, and a good pass timer in the Dr's officewhile one sits and waits.
3	B004K4RY9M	Use this and other app like it while I waiting for friends of appointments. Just wish colors were different. It keeps you busy till you name is finally called.
1	B004K4RY9M	seems very primitive;Thought it was hard to read and I did not like it at all.  Other word search products much better.
3	B004K4RY9M	We all love this game. When you have to sit in a waiting room. for several minutes it's lots better than a magazine.
1	B004K4RY9M	this is what it is and you will get what you always get with a word search game play phone
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a nice program when you have some down time. The puzzles are at different levels so you cankeep your mind sharp.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love words,reading and writing them so naturally I like word search.It is good for keeping my brain active and keeping up on my vocabulary.This game is fun.I went from easy to normal to hard and I like that you can change categories for your search.Great game!
1	B004K4RY9M	amazon has a problem because every time I try to download an app that I paid for it says that there is a problem downloading but when I don't pay for an app there is No trouble( coincidence? I don't think so.)
3	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy using this app. The word searches range from easy to hard and for me at least i always felt challenged. I recommend this app for everyone 10 years and older.
2	B004K4RY9M	the puzzles are very easy even on hard levels...not enough words for each puzzle and I have found better searches since
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a very good game for anyone it makes you spell correctly and think.  Great to play with other unknown people, makes it more challenging.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a good game but it annoys me when u find the word and u try 2 do it fast and don't go 2 the end and hold it doesn't recognize u foung the word..but its cool..
1	B004K4RY9M	does anyone know how to remove it from the kindle am still learning...this game is boring...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy doing this type of puzzle w/pen. Because of the small size of the Kindle screen, the max words is 12. I'm already spoiled w/the fact I can run my finger through the letters. The game also fades out the word after it's been found.The only 3 downsides for me is:#1. There is a timer. It won't kick you from the puzzle if you take too long, however it is there. I like to take my time looking for the word, w/the timer I can &#34;feel&#34; the &#34;gotta hurry & beat my time&#34;.#2. The words are not in alpha order so for me that makes it more time consuming while looking for the word.#3. After the word is highlighted from being picked, personally I found myself NOT looking that those letters.Still, it is an enjoyable game for anyone who likes this type of puzzle & it gives a break from solitaire. I'm not able to work on this puzzle while I watch TV (the timer).Since it is free, give it a try.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this it has maybe improved my eyesite. the words seem to jump out at me . i would recomend this to anyone.
3	B004K4RY9M	Perhaps the screen is not made for my fat fingers but I often have trouble lining up the words - sometimes a dozen tries to get it right. Otherwise, I like it.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a good game ......not too many words. Love playing it on my new  Kindle fire I received for Christmas.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always enjoyed the word search in the magazine's and when I traveled I always had one who me.  This way is simple and it is always ready to play.  A good way to pass the time when I was waiting for a plane.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearch Unlimited Free  by JiuzhangTech Ltd has really neat moves. I like the way that any word you find and highlight disappears from the list of words to find.
1	B004K4RY9M	Had to remove it from my kindle because it is kinda too small for my likes and too easy.  ...
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search game is easy to use and it makes you think.  I have trouble putting it down as it can be addictive.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy word searches so this is pretty cool 2 play and very entertaining :) if u like games like this
3	B004K4RY9M	THIS GAME IS VERY CHALLENGING TO THE PLAYER. IT COULD HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFICULTY LEVELS FOR PLAYERS TO CHOOSE FROM. IT IS A GOOD GAME .
2	B004K4RY9M	I can't play it very long because  it becomes real easy for me! I guess I should upgrade it may be harder!
3	B004K4RY9M	I really enjoy this game. As soon as you finish one game your ready to try again. I enjoy the fact that there are not too many words to find so the screen dosen't get cluttered and the games go fairly fast. Thank you:)
1	B004K4RY9M	Just do not like. Can't think of anyting to say except don'tlike. Probably would not recommend. Not much more to say
3	B004K4RY9M	Like this one, it's as simple and easy as they come.  I really like it because it's good for the mind!
3	B004K4RY9M	Very great app to exercise the brain, i really enjoy playing this game during my times off is a good hobby
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like thiis word search, it is easy to understand and works really well. I would recomend it to all
2	B004K4RY9M	When looking for something not to consuming, it is kind of stress free.  It is also fun to share with my grandkids.
3	B004K4RY9M	I still play it. Recommend for all ages. It helps you spell and keeps you mind shartp.
3	B004K4RY9M	Word Search is a great game to use on my Kindle. It's very clever and great to use. It was priced right and I'm glad I got it.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is such a great Mind Game/You can check your skills at finding words to stimulate the Brain.I would recommend adults and middle to high school ages.I enjoy the game very much.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this! I love wordsearches I would recommend this to anyone that loves searching for words Have fun with this search..
3	B004K4RY9M	I would prefer a FONT (or type of print) that is easier to read..  The FONT that is used for this contains many letters that have lines going out from them that make them difficult to decipher.  I much more plain type of FONT, such as the one displayed on this App would be much easier to read.
1	B004K4RY9M	You cant see all the words you need to find and I have a Nook Tablet....Sooo not worth it...and its free
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoyed this word game very much untill allof a sudden you informed me I could not play it anymore because I was not connected to the internet or some such .I lost my scrabble game the same way and next you took all my games so now my kindle is worthless It does not do anything. My children went together and bought this for my 82 birthday, but I am afraid they wasted their money. They need to try and get their money back.
3	B004K4RY9M	My husband found this on my kindle fire and I didn't think I would like it. but now we have been going back and forth to see who can find the words faster. I love how you can change the background.
1	B004K4RY9M	THE REASON I DON'T LIKE IT IS BECAUSE PART OF THE GAME IS IN UPPER AREA WHERE YOU CAN HARDLY SEE THE LETTERS AND THE GAME IS TO SMALL AND NOT VERY CHALLENGING.
2	B004K4RY9M	She likes it and I think I would like it too. I am not ready to put it on my Kendle yet. She has it on hers.
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like Word Search in paperback then you will love it on your tablet. Fun and recommended to anyone who likes word games.
2	B004K4RY9M	Limited to only 15 words, but still a quick realaxing diversion. Sometimes comes up with words that are not words.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very enjoyable game.  It's fun to try to 'beat your best time'.  Unlike some word searches, you really REALLY have to search for the words.  The print gets tricky at times as well as the over-lapping of three letter words, but in all, it's a good game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have word search books, but having the one I have on my iPad is great and easy to use.  I recommend it highly
2	B004K4RY9M	The only problem I have is that you if you don't start and stop on the exact letters, the pad does not accept it.  You also have to go over the letters exactly and can't go over to the right or left  by a hair otherwise again, the pad will not accept your answer.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun game.  It is challenging and entertaining.  My husband and I worked on the word searches on our recent plane flight.  Good way to keep busy and kill time.
3	B004K4RY9M	good word search app, different levels of difficulty and pretty straightforward for what the app is. would recommend for anyone who enjoys wordsearch
2	B004K4RY9M	just ok. hard to high light the words at times. different colors of high lite would be good for this game
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always liked word searches and this is great to keep my mind moving when I have wait time.
2	B004K4RY9M	some of the words will not take hold when you scan them.  there seems to be a glitch in the program.
3	B004K4RY9M	i give this a five i can play anywhere.my mother even loves to play.no learning curve easy to access .i think everyone should get this.people of all ages can play.
3	B004K4RY9M	For a free game it is very good.It has a simple interface which is surprisingly easy to use.Looks great on my Kindle Fire.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always enjoyed playing word search, it is a fun game that many other people have enjoyed playing also.  I highly recommend it if you enjoy word search.
3	B004K4RY9M	when I found this game I stayed up all night playing it and its so cool because when ever you get a word the Colorado of the high lighter changes!
3	B004K4RY9M	please consider decreasing these pesky popus ads so the games can be enjoyed without frustration or you may be losing satisfied customers
3	B004K4RY9M	I chose Wordsearch to increase brain power especially playing all word games.  This is easy to play and keeps us on our toes.  I give Wordsearch books to my mother to help keep her mind sharp.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have a difficut time clicking on the correct letter and getting the game to accept it. Its a little slow
3	B004K4RY9M	&quot;Wordsearch Unlimited Free&quot; is an awesome app to get!I got it on my Kindle Fire,and it works just fine!This app is great for kids like me, it's a thinking app,and it kind of teaches us how to spell words, so it's good for education.It's also great for adults, too!GET IT!:)
1	B004K4RY9M	Very boring, did not care for it at all.  However I normally do not like this type of game I really prefer crossword puzzles as compared to word search games.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is one of the better Word Search games out there for free.  My nieces and nephews love it very much.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is great. Great way to give your brain a workout in a short period of time.Fun way to compete against yourself and try to beat your best time. Would recommend this.
2	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy this app for quick easy fun.  One problem with a small Kindle Fire screen is it is hard to put your fingertip on the exact letters so it takes practice to get the "fingering" just right on Wordsearch Unlimited.
3	B004K4RY9M	It is as billed--a word search.  There are no bells, whistles, frills, or anything fancy, however if you like word searches, it is fun and free.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love finding words in puzzles.  Now I won't have to keep buying word find books and have to keep up with pencils.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like this game it has big and little words an it is a very large clear application. The word connect well.
3	B004K4RY9M	Really enjoy doing puzzles and this is so easy to do and yet u r tjimed so u r always trying to be at number 1.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great game if you like searching for words in a mess of letters.  All the words are at the bottom of the screen...once you find  each word.....you feel a since of accomplishment.  .
2	B004K4RY9M	Not really what I expected.  Somewhat disappointed in the lack of challenge presented by this app. Perhaps more suited for younger customers.
1	B004K4RY9M	I love word searches an so do my 6 and 10 year oles so I downloaded this app. It's ok as far as word searches go but two things I don't like...first, they use words that I think are unessary like sex or hell. There are enough words in the English language you could use without using words that parents may not want their miss to &quot;search&quot; for. The second thing is the words could be spread out better.There is a third thing I should add, the game sometimes has a problemregistering the word you cross off. we ha e had to cross a word up to 4 times to get the gae to accept it.Parents, beware.
3	B004K4RY9M	Word search is one of my favorite down times... there is nothing more relaxing to me. This is a great app that lets you change the background, whether it be to your own picture or pre-set. Font is different with different backgrounds, which is great if you have bad eye-sight. 3 levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Good stuff I say.
3	B004K4RY9M	The game &#34;Word Search Unlimited (Free) is a great game. I can spend hours on games like this one. If you like puzzles this one is the one to try.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is a great was way to keep the mind alert and from falling asleep from not keeping it going.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great game. I have enjoyed it. I like that I was able to download it for free. This is a great find.
3	B004K4RY9M	I loved word Search ,it is a lot of fun trying to find all the words .And again it is a great time passer
3	B004K4RY9M	When you are waiting at a Doctors office this is a good game to pass time with. Keep your brain active!
3	B004K4RY9M	People, quit giving this bad reviews just because it doesn't work perfectly on your tablet.  Need I remind you that these games were developed for PHONES, not tablets?  If you want an app that will work perfectly on your tablet, go download an app that was actually MADE for tablets!That said, this game works fine, although like others have mentioned, it can be difficult to get the lines in the right place.  Still, this is the best word search app out there, and it's free.  I can't complain.
3	B004K4RY9M	it is a good word search game.............I like it just to have something to do while waiting in dr offices, etc.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love most word games because they can be challenging.  My children like to play it too.  They want to see who can get the lowest time.  I think it is great but I hate it when they beat my time:)
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a fun game. It turned out to be easy to use and keeps me busy. My son enjoys it as well.
2	B004K4RY9M	It's ok nothing exciting about it. It does help the kids with their words but otherwise a bore. I have books for this.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like word search and this is very challenging to play.  would like to see more words to search for
3	B004K4RY9M	Its pretty good for being a wordsearch game for my kindlefire for the first time.Even though I'm open for suggestions for other wordsearch apps.Maybe if they added a little relaxing music' I would give it 5 stars.
2	B004K4RY9M	This app is not user friendly to me, I had several issues with this one. Especially when highlighting the words.
3	B004K4RY9M	For waiting in doctor's office or somewhere you need to pass the time waiting. Easy to read and easy to find!
1	B004K4RY9M	Some of the time the words that are found do not register as found no matter how often or how precise I am with my lines.  For this reason I really do not do this one very often.
3	B004K4RY9M	Awesome game for all ages.  We have played with three different generation competing to out do each other with faster times.
3	B004K4RY9M	This was a very nice app. Love to play games on my tablet and this one is very easy to do.
2	B004K4RY9M	Word searches are all the same..... Searching for words in a matrix of letters... Is it real or make believe ... maybe we are all in a matrix and some great metaphysic being is playing HumanSearching Unlimited Free (Kindle Earth Edition) application game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this app. I love doing word search puzzles. And this app is excellent. I love working the puzzles.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like playing with words and keeps my brain in function, I really enjoy playing it.  hope some people will enjoy it also.
1	B004K4RY9M	I realized that I do not like word searches. It is a bit boring. It took a long time to download also.
3	B004K4RY9M	The price is right, of course --- FREE!!  And with three different levels of difficulty, I LOVE IT!!  Layout options are great.  I've had no problem with the app keeping my highest scores as others have seemed to have.
3	B004K4RY9M	I put this on my Kindle so my mother would have another game to play when she borrows it. Then I started playing it. It's a perfectly fine word search game. It would be nice to have the option to enlarge the board and add more words, but it's fun the way it is.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is fun for one or two people to play! I ahve enjoyed playing the game and others have also enjoyed this game!
3	B004K4RY9M	I love Wordsearch games.  I like to play it at work on my lunch break I have the books to play but this is much easier
3	B004K4RY9M	I thought this would be something different to do when I sick of reading books on my kindle. And it would be something to keep the mind working.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is very addictive. I love puzzles and word search is one of my favorites. I'm glad that I received this.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have not been playing this as much as some of the others that I have but it has some challenges to it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I really like this one. I play it a lot. One of my favorite ones. Would recommend it to everyone.
3	B004K4RY9M	I do love word search games but this can be a little tricky.Sometimes you find the word but the  game board won't except it so the clock keeps ticking and the game board won't except answer.
2	B004K4RY9M	I like this game.  I choose this rating because a person can make it easy or more challinging to find the words.  I would recommend this game to a friend.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game, I have done a lot of these before and these are goodfor a brain training session. You have to work fast (since you are times)and thatcan be hard to do, but it is a lot of fun to do. Everyone should have this game, itsa challenging game
3	B004K4RY9M	i've always liked these games.it's a great game to keep your mind busy. i will order more of these. it's fun to play.
3	B004K4RY9M	Doesn't present a real tough challenge, but I can work it while watching TV.  A good distraction during the Ads.
2	B004K4RY9M	When I locate a word and try to trace it with my finger, it often does not 'credit' me with finding it. It is much too sensitive to the act of tracing a word. I often have to do it 3 -4 times.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search games, I got this one for myself. It certainly keeps the brain cells clicking for we older folks.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearch is great for keeping your brain functioning properly. Really makes you think and work fast. You gotta try this one.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have played this game several times and enjoy it. I have always liked word games and always do these puzzles in local newspaper.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word games and my favorites are Bookworm and Scrabble, but did not find either in your choice of games.  Will look further.  This is a good word search game though.
3	B004K4RY9M	Its easy to play.  Big letters, easy to see.  my eyes can't read small stuff.  Battery life on the kindle is good.  Chalk board look reminds me of school.  I love games.  Thank you amazon for bringing them.  I have had my kindle about 1 week now, and i use it constantly.  This is by far the best device on the market
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a fun game to keep the mind working.I find that this type of game helps one be alert to spellingalso i try to seed up as i go alonglittle bit of "Mnd GYM"
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is so much fun to take along to appointments when you have to wait.  Also it is easy enough for kids to use.  It takes the anxiety out of waiting for an appointment.
1	B004K4RY9M	I don't like the timing thing.  You are timed in how long it takes you to find the words.Hard to get the words marked, could operator error.
1	B004K4RY9M	i downloaded this bc i love word puzzle games. it weirdly requires a lot of permissions and the puzzles have six words in them. i didn't think this was very fun so i uninstalled...i don't think i will reinstall it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I am not a huge fan of games but like this one. I enjoy playing it when I do play games. Young people & adults who enjoy word puzzles would enjoy this game.
2	B004K4RY9M	It is ok. The highlighting can be a little off and when you are timed it can be frustrating. If you like word searches, go for it. It is free so what have you got to lose.
1	B004K4RY9M	There just isn't enough with this game.  I mean.. it had word searches but they are short (not many words) graphics are not good.  It's ok but I don't really like it.
2	B004K4RY9M	This is a nice, almost intuitive game for word search lovers. It is also published in the UK, so certain items are spelled differently, or not used in American English at all.  Calling the Free version unlimited is a lie. It is not expensive to get the other version, which is unlimited, but the free version has a limited number of puzzles, puzzles sizes and catagories.
3	B004K4RY9M	And this one is always different and varied and helps me relax my mind too... works great on kindle fire
3	B004K4RY9M	Great for downtime.  No noise or music playing, it is great for an attorney's office or hospital and even the young ones like it.
3	B004K4RY9M	There is not much to this app. Just a simple word search. You slide your finger from each end of the word and the word is selected. If you complete a word, it will stay highlighted on the board and gray out on the list. The letters selected will be displayed at the bottom so you can tell which letters you have highlighted.Simple and fun game. If you like word searches, this app is for you.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like puzzle games. Word finds are fairly easy for me, but I like the timing feature and checks how fast you can find all the words. This small feature has made this game so much more enjoyable.
2	B004K4RY9M	Fun game if you have nothing else to do or have some time to kill. Usually play it at the docs office. Thanks!
3	B004K4RY9M	This one's beautiful. A nice, big screen and several gorgeous themes to choose from. The interface is responsive and I have no problems "circling" the words as I find them. I only wish there was some continuity to the word lists - but I suppose keeping the words random ensures the game retains playability even over repeated playings.
1	B004K4RY9M	It's an okay app but doesn't't seem to have much variety in the puzzles or the locations of the words. A bit more tedious than I expected.
2	B004K4RY9M	Maybe it is just me but many times the puzzles seem to have a string of words that seem to be suggestive of content with an underlying attempt to lower my standards.  The puzzles are very simple and could easily be done by older elementary school children.I have done a lot of word search puzzles (in paper book form) and have never had the uneasy feeling I sometimes get with these word lists.  Most of the puzzles are okay and help to unwind when you don't have enough time or energy for something else.
3	B004K4RY9M	I am always carryig a word search book with me wherever I go to pass tjime, while waiting.  Puzzles are short and fast!
3	B004K4RY9M	Its relaxing and fun to play. I enjoy doing word search games. I keep trying to get faster at finding the words.
3	B004K4RY9M	I will be in and out for now but it helps put me to sleep at night.put I can get to play it more .
1	B004K4RY9M	I thought I was going to really enjoy this game but it was so frustrating when I would rub my finger over the letter and it would not let me use it.  It worked on my letters but not all of them.  Does not matter if you press hard or light either.
1	B004K4RY9M	I bought this one before I purchased another...didn't like this one...not in color, letters were not block letters ...they looked handwritten, and was a little hard to work with...I wouldn't recommend this one to a friend...It may have been free for download, I don't remember but I deleted it off of my Kindle Fire..and got a different one.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is all about timing. You are timed as to how long it takes you to find the words. Fun to play with your family or against the computer opponet. This game works the best with a Stylus. Actual fingers are hard to navigate the lines.
1	B004K4RY9M	There is nothing new or exciting about this game. It is the same as you can find in a crossword puzzle book. It is rather boring and now I will have to and remove it from my Kindle HDNothing outstanding about this. Not really mind boggling. Not worth d/l it even though it is free.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a technique I use to stay focused. My abilities are limited and therefore I can relax and focus on a wordSearch. Stimulates brain activity along with other games or puzzles. Stay focusedAnd increase your brain activity. And it's old school, but works out.
3	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy playing this game.  Just got my Kindle HD 8.9 so still learning.  Thanks so much for asking about this game.
2	B004K4RY9M	This game was nice but it was too easy I didn't like the lay out at all.  Plus it would repeat itself
3	B004K4RY9M	Got this app because i needed to kill time while waiting for my classes. But overall i really like it and it really make you think and challenge your minds.
3	B004K4RY9M	I play this app a lot when im waiting in the doctors office or any where I have to wait. Its fun and helps time go by faster.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love doing this wordsearch and get very caught up in it. You can adjust the difficultity level so it can be challenging.
2	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy to conspect but am still having problems with making all the words I try to make it keeps dropping the begining letters and then won't let me go back.
2	B004K4RY9M	haven't used yet, but looking forward to it to continue to stimulate the aging mind.  I love Words with Friends and Scramble .
3	B004K4RY9M	This is with no doubt my favorite app!!!! I have been so addicted to this game!! I love this app and think it is a great way of looking and learning words you havent ever seen before.
3	B004K4RY9M	In the end, this is a basic version of word search to play on those long car trips or to kill some downtime. Find all the words using whatever means and then move on to the next puzzle to do it all over again. Down, up, sideways, diagonally...you have to find them all!
1	B004K4RY9M	couldn't get the darn game to work on my tablet. I wouldn't do anything. What a waste of money. I don't recommend it.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a great game. highly reccomend it. great for kindle fire users. Cute backtound screen and sounds.words are forward backward up and down.
3	B004K4RY9M	I do like this game much more than ones in a book which can become so messy with a pencil and a mistake :(  I also like the way the word is blacked out of the list when it is found. This one is a keeper and is also good for younger ones to keep them busy.
1	B004K4RY9M	as we love to do word searches. this app only let me do one and then it wanted me t buy the rest, too bad :(
3	B004K4RY9M	If you love finding words...this is a great game for you. Any skill level would enjoy it....nice way to pass the time!
3	B004K4RY9M	I love playing this game and I do it over and over. THe only thing I think they should change is the design underneath. The top row of letters is superimposed over the top of the frame and I personally find it difficult to read the letters there. I had to get used to that. Otherwise it's quite entertaining and just hard enough!
3	B004K4RY9M	Tons of fun if you like word searches. The words are everyday words and fairly easy to find. Need to get a stylus though to make it easier.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search games and this is a really good one. It satifies my down time. I would highly recommend this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I think this game is adictive, but after a while you'll get tired of it and will need to quit.  WordSearch is a fun game for me, but mostly because love wordsearches, and I'm good at them! If you like games that are a little challenging, get this game!
2	B004K4RY9M	This app is fun but the puzzles are too short and simple. It generally takes about a minute or so to solve. It would be nice to have the puzzles more of a challenge.
1	B004K4RY9M	I didn't have any real issues with this app, I used it on the kindle fire and everything was easy to use. I wish there was a difficulty setting because it's way too easy, and the biggest disappointment was out of the blue it would no longer allow me to use the app while not connected to the Internet. which doesn't work for me since I normally use it when I don't have access to the Internet.
2	B004K4RY9M	I really love wordsearches and think this app is good... I gave it only three stars because, the levels don't change and you can not progress or do harder boards. Just a little more twinking and it could be good! :)
3	B004K4RY9M	I like playing but sometimes I find it too easy to do and not quite as challenging as I would like.
3	B004K4RY9M	I would consider this a good game and I like word games. This is a definite game I would download.
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game very much. It differs a bit from most of this type game, in that sometimes the words are backwards, which provides a little more challenge than most word search games I've tried. I like doing this game every day if I can fit it in to my schedule. It makes me feel like I'm exercising my brain a little bit. I recommend it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Really easy to use on a Kindle, lots of puzzles so it lasts a long time and has short and long words to find.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have not yet had an opportunity to play this game, but it is waiting for me on my Kindle.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love doing word search books and this game is the same. I used to buy word search books all the time but now I play these and save alot of money too. I recommend this to everyone old and young who like to do word search.
2	B004K4RY9M	it only gives a few words at a time and I find them immediately, usually less than a minute. if it has a word with a rare letter like Q or Z it will on put one of that letter on the board. kind of boring.
3	B004K4RY9M	I just love to play this game.  For me, it is fun and sometimes challenging - especially when your up against the clock.  I would recomend this for anyone who plays this game.
2	B004K4RY9M	The background is cute, but some of the words are above the blackboard. I wold like to increase the difficulty of the game and its size. Its a fun game, but the games over in a few quick minutes.
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is my anti-alzheimers exercise.  I play it a little every day. Might be just my imagination but i think it makes my mind sharper. lol
3	B004K4RY9M	in my spare time i love my puzzles of all sorts so im a real big user on this and now it saves me $on buying my booksfrom 1$-5bucks
1	B004K4RY9M	Did not care for!
3	B004K4RY9M	I have not used it yet, but love the wordsearch in books and newspapers.  I will review later after I tried it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love it. It's easy and simple, and the words are easy to find most of the time. Diagonal selections are a little difficult, but not bad. It wants to jump around a bit....but that could be due to an operator retard moment. LOL!
3	B004K4RY9M	I like word search puzzles,  This word search is fun my only problem is I am used to the ones in books that sometimes do not have a time limit on completion.  Not to mention I like more than 8 word in my word searches.  This one is good and all but I find I get stumped on a word and then it takes a while to get going.  Or I'll be doing find and have difficulty on the last word.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search books. Great to take on a bus or plane. Now I don't need a pen!  Only one complaint is that there isn't enough time to study the word list
3	B004K4RY9M	I love Word Search but have a hard time getting the word highlighted.  The heat of my fingers that should highlight will not highlight it.
3	B004K4RY9M	I wanted a game app that you could play fairly quick but still require some thinking, this game is perfect !
1	B004K4RY9M	downloaded this free game for my Kindle Fire for a friend. It was ok the game looks like a black and white printed page. In order to change or fix color's it wants you to upgrade and we didn't want to pay for an upgrade. So I deleted the game after my friend played it. I have no interest in the game. Perhaps you will like it so give it a try. :)
3	B004K4RY9M	This is another book to help keep my brain young.  Since the game keeps track of how fast I find all the words,  I try to beat my time each time I play.
2	B004K4RY9M	i like to have to look for the words  great one issue is afew times I not able to follow my finger to mark the word
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game but sometimes the word doesn't light up immediately even when I slide my finger over it which frustrates me sometimes, but I love word search games!
3	B004K4RY9M	Word Search puzzles are a favorite of mine. This is a wonderful app. Works great and puzzle after puzzle is gives you endless challenges. The words are well hidden, It is enough of a challenge to keep you interested. It is a wonderful time passer. But be careful a little addictive.
2	B004K4RY9M	I looked forward to doing a word search in an electronic format, BUT it was disappointing.  I would find the word, but the line on the screen would not stay and it took seconds to unnecessarily redraw the line.  THIS AFFECTED THE SCORE, made the game frustrating, and unreliable affecting the fun of it all.Once I had to draw the line backwards causing the above affects.  FIX THAT TECHNOLOGY PROBLEM AND THE GAME WOULD BE FUN.  And a better rating would be more accurate.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is fun to play.  It helps me keep my brain smart.  I don't notice repeats ofword searches.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word search games and enjoy challenging myself.  This is how I relax.  The game is just what I expected and fun to play.
3	B004K4RY9M	i love that it is not overwhelming, so you dont get bored. however, i wish the letters were of a different font, unless i havent found that option yet.
3	B004K4RY9M	I am really enjoying this game. It's challenging, yet fun.I quit smoking 1 1/2 years ago, so I need to keep my mind occupied, this certainly helps.
3	B004K4RY9M	An enjoyable game and time passes much too quickly when you get into it!  If you like word searcjhes, this is a good one to choose.
3	B004K4RY9M	Do enjoy this game on my Kindle.  Don't play it all the time but when I do...it's fun, fun.  Sometimes it is easier then other times when I play the game
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is great to pass the time....it's fun & sharpens your attention.  It's not for everyone but I like it!
3	B004K4RY9M	If you like doing word searches this is fun!  This has some short words and long ones too...really cool way to look for words
1	B004K4RY9M	I found some words but they wouldn't highlite.  It is really maddening when you find a word and it won't highlite for you.  I only did one puzzle because it upset me that I found a word and it wouldn't give me credit for it.  I finally got it to highlight and I had one more word to go and guess what.  It wouldn't highlite it.  So I just shut it down.
3	B004K4RY9M	very fun and enjoy playing this game on my kindle fire a very fun game  to play and lots of fun
2	B004K4RY9M	I get tired of being timed. I would just like to do a relaxing word search and not watch the clock tick.  But not a bad game to have on a Kindle.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great puzzle boom. Make you real think and pay close attention to what you are looming for.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game helps keep mental sharpness by not only including long words, but also short words.  If you get stuck, there's always help.
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search app is a great piece to have if you like to just do something different. I like have to search different words for different categories.
2	B004K4RY9M	....was very easy and short.  Longer puzzles (more words) would make this better.  Not bad though for a free book of puzzles.
1	B004K4RY9M	This app did not offer the variety and challenge that a traditional word search puzzle book does.  I uninstalled it shortly after checking it out.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a well put together app. Its a nice word search app that is relaxing and pleasant to use.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is an AMAZING game because I am always doing word search puzzles and I really enjoy beating my own times!!!
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search is another great app. although I have a hard time relaxing if I am trying to beat the clock.  Of course you can ignore the clock and just have a great time searching.
3	B004K4RY9M	Play this on my kindle which I take everywhere with melike to play while sitting in the dr office or any place where I have to wait on something
3	B004K4RY9M	alot of the apps I have on my iPod the word searches list the same words again and again, but this app lists new words a lot of the time.
3	B004K4RY9M	Been playing with this helps keep the brain going and it has different levels to go thru never a boring game!
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a pretty good game, and I love puzzles, but I wish it had more words per page to search.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love to do word search. It has different patterns of every new puzzle, so it doesn't get  too boring.
1	B004K4RY9M	Looks like it would be a good time killer but the puzzles are way to small and some of the letters don't fit on the screen...un-installed it.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a great game, i have books with word search but this is a lot more fun. no erasing
3	B004K4RY9M	I'm not an avid game player but this app has worked fine and met my expectations.  Whatever ads are part of this &#34;free&#34; app are not that big a deal to me.
1	B004K4RY9M	I have a Samsung Galaxy S with Android 2.2 installed.  I tried this app and it crashed each time i tried to use it. I tried uninstalling then reinstalling to no avail.
3	B004K4RY9M	I could play thls for hours. Glad I downloaded it. I would recommend it for those that like wordsearch puzzles.
3	B004K4RY9M	great! glad i got it. I recomend it to everyone. would like to have more words to find in each puzzle.
3	B004K4RY9M	I LIKE TO DO WORD SEARCH'S, I BELIEVE IT HELPS YOUR VOCAB. AND KEEPS YOUR BRAIN ACTIVE, I LIKE THE  KINDLE WORD SEARCHING IT'S FUN,DIFFERENT!!!
3	B004K4RY9M	This game can be challenging but it is fun and sometimes you can find the words quickly. I would recommend it.
1	B004K4RY9M	Last week I did a word search game with a friend on her smartphone. It was a lot of fun. I downloaded this game hoping to repeat my good times. This game was extremely simple and offered few words to search for. I am extremely disappointed in this game, and plan to delete it very soon. I know that this game was free, but it is not worth playing.
1	B004K4RY9M	I cannot even see the words I'm supposed to be searching for, not to mention there are only 4 per puzzle.  At first I thought it was just my device but as per other reviews, I'm not alone.I even paid for this app and sill couldn't wait to uninstall. I have already downloaded another word search that was free (all the tme, not just free for the day).
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a good game and i like it to help me pass the time enjoy the game have fun
3	B004K4RY9M	Good puzzle application. Enjoy play at these puzzles often. Easy to operate and loads every time. Would recommend to any puzzle enthusiasts.
2	B004K4RY9M	I downloaded this thinking it would be slightly entertaining, but it was overly simple. If it had more letters or more difficult words to find, I may have given it a higher rating.
3	B004K4RY9M	A must for those who love word games. I am always trying to improve my scores and see if I can find more
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a very easy user friendly game.  I thought it was going to be a little more challenging, but it's good to sit down and just play.  Fun.
1	B004K4RY9M	Another app removed cause require network to even play it. Glad I had one already that not require such a stupid thing. If you not like having Wl Fi on all the time,  then not recommend.
3	B004K4RY9M	Relaxing game to play. You set the mode you would like to play in, then relax and search away.  It is timed, but I just search without thinking about the timer at all. I think you will like this game if you like Word Search games.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love it. You don't need a dictionary just focus and the words come right of the square. Today we are always trying to use a brain for numbers or letters. Keep moving enjoy and think of words that change our life.
3	B004K4RY9M	As far as word search app games go I prefer this one over the other ones out there.User Friendly. Easy to figure out.
3	B004K4RY9M	Very responsive to touch, marking words, and it tracks your response time for completing puzzles. The app loads puzzles quickly. Recommended by me.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always liked the wordsearch game and love this edition.  The only problem I have with it is to line the words out it is sometimes hard as the line will jump around
3	B004K4RY9M	This word search puzzle is awesome! It's challenging and fun. I play it every day, can't stay off of it.
2	B004K4RY9M	a good game.  Something to do when bored.  It helps keep your mind active.  You learn some new words too.
3	B004K4RY9M	kinda easy but alot of fun. It takes a little getting used to on the kindle but really fun. and free to download.
2	B004K4RY9M	IT JUST TOOK ME A FEW MINS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MARK THE WORDS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT IT IS OK
3	B004K4RY9M	I like this game. It appears better on my phone. Some of the letters are too near the top on my kindle version.
3	B004K4RY9M	This game is so addicting! Love how the games are timed. Makes it challenging. Could probably play day! Sooo much fun!
1	B004K4RY9M	I did not like this app.  I deleted it from my phone.  I found it hard to use and not fun.  If I am going to play a game I do not want it to be hard to use.
1	B004K4RY9M	In word lists that are more than two rows tall, only the first two rows are displayed on my system and they cannot be scrolled.Uninstalled; would play otherwise.
3	B004K4RY9M	Downloaded this to Kindle. Picture quality is great. Love playing the game. Have no problems. App is easy to use and game is easy to play. Would like to see more wordsearch apps.
1	B004K4RY9M	but this one let me down. Having to linger on the last letter of the word is bad. Plus I had to highlight the word several times before it was recognized. I uninstalled this app.
3	B004K4RY9M	HAVE A D2 AND WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD AND VERY SIMPLE GAMETO USE. I WOULD HAVE LIKED A FEW MORE WORDS PER GAMEBUT OTHERWISE IS GOOD
3	B004K4RY9M	Nice and relaxing app...enjoy using it when I want to just kick back and relax my mind...easy and sometimes challenging
2	B004K4RY9M	I like this wordsearch, however, I wish the puzzles contained morechallenging longer words. It contains quite a few three letter words.Other than that, it is great!  It ranks you by the time it takes to completethe search.
3	B004K4RY9M	WordSearh is a good "make you think" outside the box.  "Outside the box" is because the words can go horizontal (up & down), vertical both ways, and, from corner to corner.  I appreciate being able to finish a WordSearch, clearing and receiving a new one, without turning pages, or waiting for the next day's newspaper. This from a person who didn't think she would like a Kindle, but now likes the convenience!!!
3	B004K4RY9M	I play on it all the time, it's a fun game and you learn new words all the time. Great for a free app.
3	B004K4RY9M	some of these words are hard to find but this is a fun app and i find myself trying to bet my time i want to find all the words faster
2	B004K4RY9M	This game is good, but is a little clumsy at cooperating with the player.  Sometimes it dosen't react or respond to the touch to get a word wrote.  Not real crazy about playing it.
3	B004K4RY9M	With just a finger and a list of words you can help keep your eyesight primed, your boredom at a low, and increase your brains alertness for details. Nice.
3	B004K4RY9M	Love to do word search puzzles. Great for keeping the mind alert and learning more words as well as spelling correctly
3	B004K4RY9M	I love Word Search, its one of the games that I play almost everyday.  It challenges my brain to use speed.
1	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy word searches especially when there is some interesting music or some twist to the game. Its nice to see if you can beat your old time. This WordSearch just didn't have the oomph that a good one offers.
3	B004K4RY9M	I love word puzzles and find this fun and easy to do. It is one of the easier puzzles I have every done. I love it.
3	B004K4RY9M	Just now getting into the tablet life style and this is a good brain teasing addition. That it is free is special.
3	B004K4RY9M	There is nothing new here; but for some reason its crazy addicting. I have no idea why I like it so much but there is a certain sense on pride in finding all of the words! My daughter plays it as well. I love that it is available instantly and FREE on Kindle.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a great game to play on my iPhone while waiting for a ride or traveling in the motor home.
3	B004K4RY9M	I normally do wordsearches in books, but when I did this wordsearch for the first time, I must say I really liked it. It's a must have!!! Have FUN.
3	B004K4RY9M	I got this game APP primarily for my Mom.  She's enjoying it almost daily.  I checked on several word search games and this one was among the best.
3	B004K4RY9M	It works well on the kindle fire. You can sit for hours trying to beat your best score.  Worth the download and it's free!!!
3	B004K4RY9M	this game is alot of fun.  wish i knew how to make it harder.  it gets five stars from me.
2	B004K4RY9M	This game calls for a bit of concentration and an eye for searching for the needed words.  Good way to pass the time away
3	B004K4RY9M	Fun game but so are all word search games. if you like word search games this is a great game to get.
3	B004K4RY9M	I have always loved word search puzzles and love that this app was available.  Only have a few small issues with this app.  You can't make the size of the puzzle larger so I have to put my readers on when playing but if you have good vision you should have no problem with it.  When the app opens you have to turn your tablet vertical to play it so you have to hold the tablet up with you other hand and eventually that arm gets sore from holding it up.  The last issue is the top border of the game, would be nice if the letters started below the border as it makes the top row difficult to see. Still very happy and very addicted to this app.
1	B004K4RY9M	Started off okay but then most of the words I found would not highlight. I could figure out no reason why? Done with this game.
3	B004K4RY9M	I only did a few puzzles but it is very easy to do and I really enjoy the challenge.  I will be playing this game a lot.
3	B004K4RY9M	This is a good, quiet, fun game if you enjoy word searches. There's no competition other than beating our own time. The only issue I have is that each round is only 8 words long. I enjoy finding many words in one puzzle but I understand you can only do so much with the size of an iPhone screen. Good game overall
2	B004K4RY9M	When I am tired of Solitaire or need a break from reading or just any mindless activity wanted this wordsearch game is okay to use.  Wish it was a bit tougher so it would be more of a challenge.
3	B004K4RY9M	I wanted something to fill in time when I didn't have anything to do. This certainly fulfills that desire. This is a weakness of mind but I tend to lose interest fairly quickly when I have to do a lot of looking. But this program works well is easy to use and am happy with.
3	B004K4RY9M	here is anothe word game that takes up your time when you are waiting on a plane or a doctor
3	B004K4RY9M	Will pass the time nicely when waiting for a child, or a doctor appointment, or anything else for that matter.  Not too easy, and not too hard.
3	B004K4RY9M	I do enjoy word searches--this is your basic search and you find listed words forward, backward and diagonally. It definitely passes the time and challenges you to score higher each time.  Love this on the Kindle
3	B004K4RY9M	I love this app. It is so easy to get caught up with the puzzles that you lose so much time doing puzzle after puzzle.
1	B004K4RY9M	Format was very hard on the eyes with chalkboard background and faded white writing.  Played a few times and deleted it!
3	B004K4RY9M	Wordssearch is a nice, easy game. It would be better if the searches were categorized and became a bit more difficult the longer you played.
3	B004K4RY9M	Word Search is an entertaining little app and a great way to pass the time at airports, doctor appointments or at home. One or two words come along that are tucked away and hard to find and the challenge is on. At that point, I try to ignore the clock; I don&#8217;t need the pressure:-) But in the end, it&#8217;s all good fun!
2	B004K4RY9M	I enjoy word search at the end of my day. I sit in my favorite chair and pick-up my kindle and turn to word search and forget about everything for awhile.
3	B004K4RY9M	this is a great app that works really well on my kindle....if u like to use ur brain and if u love wordsearches or any kind of word game this is highly recommended for u
3	B004K4RY9M	Play against the clock to see how fast you can find the words, love it and always works, no bugs.
3	B004K4RY9M	Easy to play, but a bit difficult on the small Kindle screen to get your finger to follow the small area that you need. A stylus might help, maybe the bigger sized Kindle Fire HD.
3	B004K4RY9M	Nice game to while away the time. It is not to hard and is a grat learning tool for kinds learning how to read.
2	B004K4RY9M	Only reason I'm not giving it a higher rating is because it doesn't  fit all the word list on my screen.  But other than that I enjoy playing it when I want to play something that doesn't  take much time.
3	B004K4RY9M	I am glad i found this game. No need to carry around a crossword book. Also it is very challenging
3	B004K4UK02	I haven't played the standard version, of which this is an offshoot, but I'll be checking into it based on what I've seen so far.  Graphics are pretty well done, as are the sounds and upbeat background music.  I like the twists they've added to the typical tower defense game formula.  The only thing keeping this game from the 5 stars is that your units don't change in any obvious visual or audible way you upgrade them.  This makes it more difficult to keep track of which have been upgraded and to what level.
3	B004K4UK02	Not as good as the other Grave defense games but I still had fun playing.  Graphics not as good as the other games but a few change ups in the game were a fun addition.I do admit that once I played all the levels..I have not played again, it just doesn't suck me in the way the other grave defense games do. I will definitely keep it on my kindle fire in case I get the urge to challenge myself with the harder stages.
1	B004K4UK02	I was not a fan of this game. It wasn't what I was looking for. The monsters have to large an area to roam in and became too difficult to manage.
3	B004K4UK02	All of the GRaves are the best of the tower defense games genres.
3	B004K4UK02	I'm an old guy.  I played the original Colossal Cave and its offshoots, and, yes, I AM a wizard!  Bottom line...I'm jaded/  I don't like shoot 'em ups, bubble games that go faster and faster,...  When Amazon had another GRave Defense game as its free app of the day, I gave it a try out of curiosity and found I really liked the strategic puzzles it presented.  What kind of towers...when...where?  To sell?  Lots of cheap firepower or a few heavy duty pieces.  What IS going to hit me in the final wave?  Am I ready for it? And I'm not out for blood.  Easy mode is good enough for me.Each holiday presents its own set of monsters, weapons, special challenge.  My only concern is that it may--I said "may"--be a bit too challenging if this is your first tower defense game.  In that case, you might start with the free version of GRave Defense Silver to get your feet wet.Warning, though!  These games can be addictive!
3	B004K4UK02	I'm not a huge Tower Defense type gamer, but when GRave Defense HD was Free App of the Day, I was hooked. I even paid the 99 cents for the Gold version to help make up for the free HD. Once this Easter version hit the market I installed it. I love the new holiday related enemies and some new tower weapons (the boxing glove is the best). I was hoping for a version with no ads, which I would glady drop another buck on, and I hope there are more levels coming.
1	B004K4UK02	When I first opened the app, there was a 2 or 3 page disclaimer that I was required to agree with prior to playing the game.  I uninstalled the app and never played the game.
3	B004K4UKJI	Great task manager.  I sync my tasks from outlook to Gmail with gsyncit, then use this to see tasks on my android.  love the app and the widget.
3	B004K4UKJI	I have been looking for a way to track some of my deliverables.Especially longer term ones.Notepad apps and such are nice to make a quick note but with this one I can leverage the internet and update or change on my smartphone, tablet or desktop.The interface is simple enough that I don't get frustrated with too many bells and whistles, but powerful enough that I can keep my running lists orderly.Have not tried all the functions yet.I suspect I will be pleased with the additional functions.If you are looking for reliable, straightforward and easy to use and read.This is the one.
3	B004K4UKJI	I love it!!!!  I used it every day!  I love that I can use it for different list for kids, home, work, etc.
3	B004K4UKJI	Back in the day, my dad carried a little date book in his shirt pocket.  It was how he kept up with things.  I've never really cottoned on to pocket date books.  Something about them just doesn't fit the way I think or act.  The thing is, my life is filling up with a need to keep thoughts organized, and to remember things that need doing, telling, etc.  Enter the android.  I looked for a PDA, but they don't make them anymore.  I found an Android tablet instead.This app on a tablet the size of the little date book is an essential part of making the Android a tool you cannot be apart from.  It is an idea keeper and organizer.  It does not attempt to be a calendar app, though it does let you set due dates, etc.  It lets you structure notes in a deep tree structure - an essential for any app that stores information that will be accessed on a tiny screen.  You can drill down through the tree to get to the area you want... Ie... top level groups like home, work, church let you have a clean, uncluttered UI.  When you need something, say you open home and have sub groups like car, house, kids, etc.  Then under car you have ford, dodge, and under dodge, you have oil change with a due date of whatever, with notes, contact information etc.This in itself is great, but when you realize you can push up your tasks to your Google account, you realize you can access your stuff from anywhere.As far as I am concerned, this app is THE task list to have.  The grouping and tree structure depth is essential to making a task list of any size useful.
1	B004K4UKJI	doesnt work. said it synced with my account but never entered any information.won't allow adding information or snyc. rip off.
3	B004K4UKJI	This app seems to do what it says it will do so far.  It has been syncing ok with Google but I have not really had an opportunity to see if it will remind me as required.
1	B004K51V7W	Great looking game but the d pad is broken. Does not track and even fires as if its the other button. Would purchase if it worked. Changing the size of the pad made it worse
2	B004K51V7W	This is a decent tank game you can get to kill a little time. Its better than some of the older tank games out there. Nothing special on it but plays smoothly.
3	B004K51V7W	This lite version only lets you play the Survival mode, which is still a ton of fun. Very much like Battlezone from the arcades in the 80s, but with a whole lot better graphics and sound. Oh, and the lack of needing to pump it full of quarters.Controls are pretty good, very responsive.  Sound isn't too shabby either. While not complex, it's very challenging.
1	B004K51V7W	This game would not install on my Flytouch 3 Android 2.2 tablet. It looks like a cool game and the reviews make it sound interesting. Whine!
3	B004K51V7W	its a relly relly good game. but I wech its can go fastr on the terns.the tanks r relly esy to kell
3	B004K51V7W	The best tank game on kindle fire...period. Easy controls for one. Very fun. My top score: 86000. But the paid is sooooo expensive.
2	B004K51V7W	It was listed by my boys as okay but not wonderful by any means.  Maybe you have to have the real thing and not just lite version.
1	B004K51V7W	Nothing big,the graphics were bad.The lite version doesn't have very much to play with.the story is very vague and has been used up very much.But hey ,its free ,so if you are bored somewhere its should occupy you for a short time.
3	B004K51V7W	I've been playing this game for a while now: It's so much fun, so addictive, so competitive (frustratingly hard at times!) & very well done. The graphics & sound affects are great (but there's room for improvements, especially when compared to a game like AirAttack HD (Free & Paid versions.) The controls are great & placed just right around the screen, making navigation a breeze. This game been playing great on my Epic 4G, before & after I got my Froyo update recently. It's so stable & never crashed on my device, not once. You tab it open, it loads up relatively fast, you get to choose: Play, Purchase Full Version, Options (game controls), High Score, Help (I loved this section. Some of the hints given there are actually useful on the battle field!) This game saves your progress. So if you have to quit in the middle of a heated session, it will give you the option to Resume where you left or to start a New Game. However, if you get killed in action, you'll have to start from scratch (That's gets frustrating at times.)The paid version offers more levels (All in the same terrain! Dear Dev, it's your chance to shine)Bottom Line: Absolutely Great Game. The combination of visual & sound affects, the fire power & constant fierce fighting is such a Gush of Adrenaline Rush!!!PS: My highest score is 27900 points, to date at least ;-)
1	B004K51V7W	I was nice giving it two stars. I hate it. I'm being critical on games I dislike. Please read description of app, then read this
2	B004K51V7W	It gives you two of the three modes to play, both are a survial on the same map.  Its OK.
3	B004K51V7W	I like this game it starts slow and then the action picks up next thing you know the game is over, fun and exciting and you have to have good reflexes in playing this game, wow.
3	B004K51V7W	This game can get very addicting, very quickly. Controls are good, graphics are nice and the overall game play is fun. The only downside is that there are more levels and features to take advantage of that cost money every step of the way. Yes, this is the Lite version so you have to expect some limitations. Just wish there were different playing fields to try out.
1	B004K51V7W	I wouldn't recommend this game but it was ok for my first app the graphics aren't to good either........ok who am I kiddin the app sucked.......don't buy ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!
3	B004K51V7W	Awesome game good graphics fun. Yay. Yay. Yay.yay. Yay. apple. Hate this stupid twenty five word minimum... Just gonna keep typing randomly til I hit it... Done. Yay.
1	B004K51V7W	I have a PD Novel. The game installed correctly, the graphics are impressive. However, once the game starts the graphics are too slow. The controls don't respond quickly enough.
3	B004K51V7W	Us at Sam's Reviews believe this game is a very and interesting game the only parts that aren't good about the game is that you can only play for 5 minutes.- John at Sam's Reviews
2	B004K51V7W	it is okay I play it when I'm bored.  ....  .........(:):  I need to fill up the spaces .lone dwarf games inc
2	B004K51V7W	I would not get the full version the only difference is two levels and the whole game is kinda lame.
1	B004K556SC	I try downloading it and it doesn't even work. like what the heck?!!!? &gt;:( do not try to download. the other reviews should help with that idea. horrible app.
3	B004K556SC	These are basic backgrounds, patterns, and generic clipart and photos that you can use as wallpapers on your phone or tablet. I use this on my Droid 2 and on my Xoom. When I say generic, I mean you're not going to find pop stars, movie posters, etc on here.However, I have to give it 5/5 stars because I've never had an issue with setting them as a wallpaper. This app is perfect for in a pinch if you don't have time to search for something else. All you have to do is tap the pic you want, then hit set as wallpaper. Fast and easy.There is a nice variety of catgories and wallpapers. I would recommend this to anyone. I use it all the time because I get tired of seeing the same wallpaper.
3	B004K556SC	Excellent choice. Free? No matching the bargain there! It even lets you save photos as an icon for your phone contacts!
1	B004K556SC	Nice little app for the Velocity Micro T301 Cruz 7-Inch Android 2.0 Tablet :)  Not many on here are compatible because of the limited amount of RAM on the tablets, but this one WORKS, it just tries to stretch the wallpaper from the 1st screen to the 5th, centered on the home screen. :)
1	B004K556SC	Why so many creepy, naughty, inappropriate permissions? You sneaky evil developer trying to steal my info to find my baby pictures? I think I'll be finding a new spot to put my cute pics if me as a baby now.
3	B004K556SC	i love this app it is useful cause my tablet didn't have alot of background pic this app allows me to choose from a wide variety of pics also the resolution of the pics are great also
3	B004K556SC	nice backgrounds, work wonderfully on tablet, I haven't seen all of them yet but trying to work through them weekly.
3	B004K556SC	I've loved these backgrounds since I got my first Android phone, several years ago. Free, and plenty of options - you can change your background to fit your mood, your outfit or your visual preference!
3	B004K556SC	I love this background app! Never had any problems with it on my droid x. Vivid colors and high def pictures. Many to choose from.
3	B004K556SC	this app has a little bit of everything for background pics--holiday times as well as everyday use.  some nice graphics and worth checking out. used it several times during holiday season to just keep changing pictures.
1	B004K556SC	its ok, but not what I was expecting from an app. I thought there would of been more to choose from
3	B004K556SC	This app DOES support swiping through the images, contrary to one of the previous reviews (it may have been added). Simply swipe on the row of images to go through the category in groups of 3.This app is simply a link to images stored in Flikr. There are an abundance of images and categories. Since your phone's resolution is likely much lower than the image you want to use, remember to save the image to your phone and use your gallery app's crop function to lower it if it doesn't display clearly. The app allows you to save contact and favorites images as well as wallpaper. It is dead simple to use, so I'm having a hard time nitpicking to find something wrong with it. I guess it would be nice if scrolling through images was free flowing, but that would require it to load more images at a time (some of y'all have low-memory phones lol). Nicely done developer!
3	B004K556SC	I used this since my droid x1. the backrounds are very nice. there is a huge selection to choose from
1	B004K556SC	This app is really good for the ipod touch but not good for the tablet!. the pics are so small on here!  and it didnt even. work
3	B004K556SC	I looked at a lot of apps for backgrounds and did not like them. This app is what I was looking for. Lots of great back grounds and easy to use.
3	B004K556SC	I LOVE this app! There are so many amazing images. I love all the nature pictures and the dragon images. I wish it had more name selection images though. I only saw one for Jason. These images look HD, I even forwarded to my work computer and the water drops on a leaf image looks just as good on the big screen!
3	B004K556SC	All I can say is "WOW"!  Fantastic photos and artwork!  It works well on my 7" White Pandigital Novel!
3	B004K556SC	Backgrounds offers a huge catalog of more than 10,000 images to set as your Android phone's wallpaper. 50 unique categories--ranging from such disparate topics as "Funny" and "Cute" to "Military" and "Scary"--offer a massive variety of cool images to choose from, and more images are added daily. This very true.
3	B004K556SC	Really neat friends and familyt thought it was beautiful pictures. Fun to play around with! Download was quick and easy. Try it, you will love it!
3	B004K556SC	A lot to choose from, I like to change my background a lot, for holidays or for the fun of it.
3	B004K556SC	I love this App. The most beautiful Pictures and easy to use. I recoment it to anyone wanting to liven up their backgrounds
3	B004K556SC	I like the catigories feature. and love how every time i use it there r new ones!  Also has a favorites button so u can use them later w/ out having to search for them again. One of the only background apps that works on my device.
3	B004K556SC	A good app if you're indecisive about backgrounds like I am. Has tons of categories and best of all they are free.
3	B004K556SC	I had this app on my first tablet and LOVED it. The graphics of each background are amazing and there are so many choices.
3	B004K556SC	Very Nice I am happy to have this free app. Lots of choices all types of backgrounds for all types of people.
3	B004K556SC	This is a great little app for getting backgrounds. I like the interface. It is just what it says it is. I would recommend this to anyone looking for more backgrounds.
3	B004K556SC	this app is loaded with tons of fabulous images that bring your screen to life. It was to pick just one. easy to use and hours of enjoyment with lots of options
3	B004K556SC	Love this app still use it  and I'm on my 3rd phone since I purchased this  Love the colors and unique pictures
2	B004K556SC	The pictures included are actually pretty nice and diverse, but unfortunately they are not the best quality, especially for high resolution phones.
3	B004K556SC	I got this to change the background and it seems to have almost anything that you can imagine.Some very nice pictures and some that are just plain.  I like the space and futuristic ones.
1	B004K556SC	I was so excited to download this app - I loved the pictured that I'd seen in the images section. However, I once I got it on my phone, I only had the patience to look through 8 pictures or so. Each page has 4 pictures on it, and takes about 5 minutes for that one page to load. I tried to change the category of pictures, and after 'thinking' for a few minutes, it told me that "categories are not availiable". They'd been there before that, so I think it's just a very slow app. I thought that it might be the internet on my phone, but I pulled up several other internet-based apps that worked just fine. The app is just slow. Big disappointment. (This was on a T-Mobile Sidekick 4G - in case maybe it just doesn't like this particular phone)
1	B004K556SC	Not worth it. I was looking for newer backgrounds to choose from and this app didn't have much, plus it has nearly all the same back grounds as other apps.
2	B004K556SC	great selection of wallpapers and doesnt take up much memory.. only complaint is some pics dont fit my 10.1 screen.. but i just find another that does..
3	B004K556SC	Beautiful collection of pictures and while i typically veer only towards the nature oriented pics, but the sheer diversity is staggering.
3	B004K55CQ8	Designed to be cool.
1	B004K55CQ8	its so much fun but on my kindle fire I made more 10 and they disssappered from my gallery and it takes for ever to load
1	B004K55CQ8	The app would load, say weemee has stoped and go to the main screen when I try to create a weemee
3	B004K55CQ8	it is so fun to create different avatar's I could play this game all day it is so fun to do it I love it
3	B004K55CQ8	1 time I played this on my friends ipod and was dying to get it on my kindle......yippie I'm so happy!!!
1	B004K55CQ8	It doesn't work. It doesn't even let me make a guy it just crashes. It is the worst app,out there. At least it's free
3	B004K55CQ8	Very fun and entertaining! Although, I have no clue how to save an Avatar or WeeMee or MeeWee or whatever you call it... :)
3	B004K55CQ8	this app is so much fun! there are so many options to choose from that you will never get bored. I have made every member of my family already and many of my friends. I love love LOVE this app and recommended it to anyone who likes creating people! (:
3	B004K55CQ8	its kind of limited with the options for the avatars, but its great considering its free! i probably wouldn't pay for it though.
3	B004K55CQ8	best avatar creator game I ever played! I made everybody in my family! I have a complicated family too! I'm awesome
3	B004K55CQ8	This is really cool! I made a lot of people in this awesome app!! It helps me express my feelings!! The only problem is that they cost money and it doesn't save once in a week, and it doesn't even open the app for once in a week.
3	B004K55CQ8	please fix the force close on kindle fire. I REALLY love this app but whenever i get to shirts it force closes. i really want it to fully function for full effect. please please please please fix....
3	B004K55CQ8	so this app is so much fun but has a few flaws....1. Sometimes I am forced to close it.2. There are no hot pink Colorado for the outfit besides the hair.3. On the kindle in the gallery they put random photos I didn't even create.
1	B004K55CQ8	this game is alot of fun untill you get out of the game and load it again. the problem is that every time i reloaded it all my creations werent in my gallery. waste of time. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME PEOPLE!!!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this app I have it on my ipod and my kindle fire. the one thing I dont like is that on the kindle you cant buy new clothes and accessories like on the ipod so its the same old stuff. but other than that its a awesome app!!!! 8-P  8-)
3	B004K55CQ8	I wish you could chat with other members from this game. Also it forced closed on me twice. If you have any other games get them for the kindle fire.
3	B004K55CQ8	I think this is a FANTASTIC app because it's not inappropriate, and it's really fun! I've recommended this app to all my friends and they all love it! (so do I) :)
1	B004K55CQ8	this just tells you to download a different app but the weemee. just stop so if I were you do not even download
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this app/game! Its a great way to pass time. I have made everyone in my family and a few celebrities. I recommend this.
1	B004K55CQ8	this app SUCKS u click make new avatar and it goes to it but says force close sorry and completely exits u out of the game do not get this app
1	B004K55CQ8	It looked like a fun app, but I couldn't even get my avatar created without "Force Close" happening constantly. Don't waste your time, it'll only freeze up your Kindle.
3	B004K55CQ8	I loved this game I even made a weemee of my boyfriend! this game is the best I love it so freaken much! you must get app!
3	B004K55CQ8	It's really fun until u run out of people to make but I guess when that happens u can just goof off and make whatever u want!!
2	B004K55CQ8	it is fun and all until u get bored I mean all u do is dress up peopleits fun I guess
3	B004K55CQ8	this is fun best fashion game Eva got it on kindle. free too! pretty fun. I mean srsly. get it. I mean its free.
3	B004K55CQ8	this is a great app but it needs to be updated. it still has things from halloween and it doesn't have most pf the stuff that is on the weemees in the picture. but it is fun anyways and a good dress up app.
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this app its so fun! everything about it is great but it isn't free,  that is the only problem.
3	B004K55CQ8	I am nuts about avatars, and the different avatar applications to make or redo your avatar. I really like this application the best.
2	B004K55CQ8	it used to be fun but now VERY GLITCHY i paid for more outfits and its not even showing up and when i save one it deletes so i cant even really use it now needs to be fixed very fast or i shall delete! :D
3	B004K55CQ8	Its really cute and you have a ton of fun props and scenery and things and you can make the avatar look just like someone. i recommend it its a good way to kill time
1	B004K55CQ8	warning everyone that might buy this for their kindle fire! this app makes you download software to acess and use this app. its disappointing because i wanted to use this app to have pictures on my devise but i couldnt even acess it without downlosdimg some weird software.
2	B004K55CQ8	hey its free!!!!! anyway this app is cool but for the fire its the size of a smart phone! &gt;:( also.its hard to use considering the smallness! but I like it I.guess
1	B004K55CQ8	iPod version was better. In the Kindle Fire version all of the clothes and stuff are off center to the left by like a half centimeter. I love the iPod WeeMee but found this disappointing. Also the hats cut off all hair so long hair will not flow over shoulders. When wearing a hat all hair stops at the jawline. there's several flaws like this. maybe I'll try it again in a couple months, but for right now I'm uninstalling until they fix these problems.
3	B004K55CQ8	omg I Luv it its so much fun it gets ur mind ready to think about wht putfit ur going to put @n him/herand imagine
1	B004K55CQ8	Please believe me when I tell u it crashes!!No joke!! it is absolutely STUPID!!!!!!!! And when it said it needed to download another thing I was like ok until it took 20minutes to download!!!!!!! (&bull;__&bull;)thought id add it!&lt;(  )&radic;/  \
3	B004K55CQ8	This app is really fun,but it automatically saved the pictures of my avatars to my pictures  folder and when I deleted them, it deleted my characters too.
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this game!!!!!!!!! its so fun makeing avatars of my friends and seeing their response. the only thing I don't like is the way u pick ur items I wish it was a list like on the side or something or instead of having to touch an item to see the rest u can just scroll it from the bottom but still love it!!!!!!!
1	B004K55CQ8	I agree. fun entertaining great. but I made these cool people on my kindle and I don't know how to save. that made it 2 stars
1	B004K55CQ8	I love WeeMee. but on Kindle Fire it crashes when you try to make one. at first it worked fine, but the next day it just showed a white screen when I clicked create. I uninstalled and reinstalled and then it just started saying error when I clicked create. I kept trying and then it finally kicked me out of the app.too bad. it's a four star app without the glitches.
3	B004K55CQ8	Omg I love this app.This fashion game is so so so so fun.I love the colothes you can get;but I wish they would add more colothes and hair styles so they would have a tone of colothes.But other wise it is a great game.
2	B004K55CQ8	This app is fun. Lots of options. I do wish eyebrows were an option though. My biggest complaint is that my saved files keep disappearing. Not sure why they don't save...
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this app. You can make lots of fun characters. I make one everyday based on my mood. So tap install now with no hesatation.
1	B004K55CQ8	This used to be a good app. But now it deleted all of my avatars and I cannot create more. I believe that if it actually worked on my kindle fire, it would be worthy of a five-star rating.
3	B004K55CQ8	great. I rate it a 4 because there needs to be more clothes and hair and shoes and other stuff. I have made a lot of people so its really cool!!!!!
2	B004K55CQ8	This app is really a lot of fun but it glitches a lot. I had 7 weemees in my gallery, where they get saved, and then they got erased somehow. Also it glitches a lot when you make them. Sometimes it starts you over, and sometimes it quits out of the app. Other than that though, its truly awesome!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	so I like it but all you do is make an avatar you don't get to do anything with them
1	B004K55CQ8	TOTALLY DON'T GET! You have to buy everything and you won't even be able to get to the real game unless you wait like FOREVER! I would rate it ZERO stars if you could. Amazon should really change that!
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this app! You can create anyone you want from a celebrity to your sister!! Then you can save them to your device or upload them to the Internet. So worth the download!
3	B004K55CQ8	it is very fun and awesome to play and creating new mees so get it now and I mean now!!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	I LOVE IT AND I MEAN LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it is so fun I love lovie love it and I know you would to!!!!!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	This game is soo fun and addicting if I were you I would buy this game not only is it fun but it's FREE!!! It's so much fun I love it #Worth it!!!! It also lets you create characters I made one of me like 50 of my closest friends and all my fave crushes, boy bands, and singers (Justin Bieber)!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	Love it but I just wish u could do stuff with the people. But other wise it's AWESOME !!!
3	B004K55CQ8	I use this app for my contact photos all the time and i love showing them off 2 my friends but the screen is so tiny that Kt is hard to see! i give this 4 stars. they need 2 upgrade
1	B004K55CQ8	I got this on my kindle... and when I started to make my own weemee I thought it would have all of the clothes in the shop(well most of the stuff that is from the shop on weeworld) but it doesn't even give u pretty stuff and u cant even choose ur own face stuff(like choosing the eyes for example) u have to click on the figures to have what u want... I didn't even enjoy it... I thought that it would be as much as fun as the weeworld site... but its not... I deleted asap Bc it was so boring... all u do is dress up a weemee... it would be better if they at least let us sign in our own accounts from the site to their and just change ur own weemee and/or reply to any messages(or accept friend requests)... but apperantly not...
1	B004K55CQ8	You need this weird software.Maybe not on the upper but on the kindle it closes the app if you don't download the software.L.A.M.E.
3	B004K55CQ8	Its really good. I can show my friends how I make their appearance look, and you can have different themes you could buy, And its really great. :-) See ya
1	B004K55CQ8	I don't know about other hand held devices but I know for a fact that this app does NOT work for Kindle Fire. It won't let you create! It closes out of the app and says &quot;WeeMee has stopped&quot;. I know how to make it stop doing this every time. 1st, go to the gallery. 2nd, go back to create. Your welcome :)There is a 50% chance of it not saving so watch out for that! I'm ticked off with this app
3	B004K55CQ8	Works great on the Kindle Fire.  It saves to your gallery, where you can crop it and make it full screen.  Wish you could add them to the Kindle start screen.  Still alot of fun.
3	B004K55CQ8	I love this game! WeeMee is a fun game, It lets you make characters and save it as a profile picture in your contacts. Although this game is used with real money you can get free clothing to dress up your  WeeMee. My favorite thing about weemee is the competition that goes on! I hope you liked my review
3	B004K55CQ8	This continues to be lots of fun!  This is cool for &#34;kids&#34; of all ages!  Good even for younger children.
2	B004K55CQ8	I don't use it very often since I joined POGO which is a lot more involved This game just didn't peak my interest.
2	B004K55CQ8	All this app does is allow you to create a WeeMee character to save as an image file. That's it. There are no games, etc. I wasn't disappointed, necessarily (it is nice to have a WeeMee character for your tablet, to keep on--hand), but I guess I was expecting something more.
3	B004K55CQ8	I 100% love this game because you dress the boys and girls to how ever style you want. but you don't have many choices to choose from. well thank you for making this AWESOME game. I LOVE IT!!!!
3	B004K55CQ8	luv the app so so so so so much but in all the pics the girls have eyelashes I want thembut I cant find them! help!
1	B004K55CQ8	i cant even get one created without it forcing close!! Fix the bugs for galaxy s aviator!! i would rate higher for the cute idea but it wont work long enough to try it out.
1	B004K55CQ8	I just fl this app and their closet. went to create a new weemee and a popup window says the application unexpectedly closed. wtf. will not work on my kindle fire
3	B004K55CQ8	This is an awesome avatar creator! It is sooooo fun! I would recommend it to anyone that loves fun apps. It works perfectly on the kindle fire but the picture is a little small.
3	B004K55CQ8	I love it, it's on my favorits on my kindle fire I am on it all the time I couldn't love it more...
3	B004K55CQ8	the only reason I'm giving it a 3star rating is because I have not yet downloaded it and people say that u r not able to save. I'm a bit confused to believe or not to trust them.
3	B004K55CQ8	This game is fun but it has some setbacks. It takes up 15% of your data and half the time it won't even load. I have it on my kindle fire and it was a free app. I would not pay for this app though.
3	B004K55CQ8	this app is sooo fun it can create a lot of fun avatars and they are cool really cool so get it
3	B004K55CQ8	Grandkids and kids at heart love making their own &#34;people&#34;.  Design locations costumes and accessories of all sorts.  Try it!
2	B004K55CQ8	i love this app but i have a kindle fire and it is as small as a phone screen. very fun app though. i recommend it.
2	B004K55CQ8	This app is cute and fun to play with. I think kids will enjoy making different characters and giving them different faces and clothes. It worked well on my Kindle Fire. I played with it a few times, but it loses it's interest pretty fast.
1	B004K55CQ8	I have one question, why can't upgrade do the contest on this version but u can on the IPod version? I'm actually very disappointed and wish it had the contest because otherwise this app is boring and highly repetitive. Please add in the contest if possible.
3	B004K55CQ8	It was ok for a short time. My niece played it and liked it for about a week.
3	B004K55CQ8	I really love this app, but it wouldn't let me get on, crashed a lot.  It was very annoying how it would not show stuff or delete my characters. Also, I got a free thing from the closet on there and the stuff wouldn't show up. I really like it, but the glitches are very annoying. Thanks
1	B004K55CQ8	this game is so gay it should not even get a star. the people have no hands or feet. wtf! what is with the title, it sounds like weewee. who even create this game!?!? it sucks!
3	B004K55CQ8	Works well on kindle fire. Cute and a lot of fun for all ages. Like the straight jacket and bunny slippers.
3	B004K55CQ8	this app is great.but the web site rocks more.on this app u can create a lot from your self to your fav celeb.
3	B004K55CQ8	it's a cute app for making yourself and your family and friends into cartoon characters. I would rate it five, but I'm stumped on what else to do with it? Very easy, and I got lot's of likes on facebook ;-)
3	B004K55CQ8	I'm writing this for my 11 year old daughter. She says there was a lot to do and you can choose how to dress them.
1	B004K55CQ8	If you use this on your Kindle for an avatar of something, it will be black. I would only use it to play around with. Not recommended to use for an actual avatar. Sorry. :(
1	B004K55CQ8	It is not good especially do not get it on the kindle fire is very very glitchy whnever I want to play it it says &quot;wee mee has stopped&quot;  it works probably 10% of the time
2	B004K55CQ8	I like the app but it wont save my avatars!!! Every time I make and save a wee mee and close the app then open it again to make another avatar my gallery is empty. I enjoy the app I just wish they would save:( Please fix so it will work on my kindle fire!!
3	B004K55CQ8	On my kindle, it's great but doesn't update it. Plz fix this issue. Btw just go into ur gallery then go out of it and back into the weemee creator. U do have to do it every time, but still works.
1	B004K55CQ8	I down loaded this on my kindle and tried all the things and nothing works I disagree with the other comments but at least I did not have to pay for it .If I did I would be so mad,If it would have worked I would probably change my review to a 500000!!!!!!!But I guess not..........DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR YOUR KINDLE,PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!
2	B004K55CQ8	This app worked fine on my fire until i tried to import my saved file to the twitter app. No go. So, fun to play with, but not sure how practical.
1	B004K55CQ8	it keeps deleting all my people and progress, and purchases. keep the idea, remove the problem, it keeps exiting out and almost never works./
1	B004K55CQ8	When I tried to play the game and it was loading I wasn't  working it just went to a white screen and said weemee has stopped If I can put this on a Scale 1-1000000 I would put it on a big fat 0 so I recommend to not get this app
3	B004K55CQ8	This app isn't that great.... I have many complaints.1. Its slow at times.2. When I try to go to &quot;create&quot; it has a pop up then before I can click &quot;force close&quot; it disappears.3. The people look fat.Ok #3 isn't really a complaint but they really do look fat and I can never get them skinny. But if the creators can fix #1 and #2 I would be really really really happy.
1	B004K55CQ8	I have been sending feedback to the wee mee industry but they have not been doing ANYTHING. There are about 6 things that need to be changed. Do not get this app and waste your time.
3	B004K55CQ8	Me and my friend absoloutly love this app its so funny we made everyone from Justin beiber to mick jagger I highly suggest getting it, the only thing is that it doesn't have a lot of options but it definetly has enough for u to play with it
1	B004K55CQ8	All I was looking for was an app like buddy poke, and then I found this. First of all it's a big download, takes up 15 gb. Second, when it was done downloading, I tapped create. It loaded for about 2 seconds and it said it stopped, taking me back to my home screen. Waste of my time and space. Guess I better keep looking.
3	B004K55CQ8	Get the app your love it  if you get I promise this will be your favorite app ever if you say you hate it you not nice because it is  awesome
1	B004K55CQ8	There really isn't much to this program, not what I thought it would be.  Was a bit disappointed due to lack of options to choose from.
3	B004K55CQ8	This is an awesome creative app! I create my friends, family, and much more.this all is truly incredible! With all the closets you can buy
1	B004K55CQ8	I had this twice already and I thought how it will be better well I thought wrong. when I tried to create one it kept on saying Sorry!
1	B004K55CQ8	I got this game because I saw some avatars on picollage and I thought they were cool. So I downloaded this app. When I hit create it will log me out of the game and back to my home screen. Don't get this app. It is a waste of time and space.
1	B004K55CQ8	I don't know if anyone else is having this problem but when I create a wee mee, it doesn't save and the whole app shuts down when I try to save it.  I have a kindle fire HD and if I figure this out, I'll redo my review and change my point of view but it's just a heads up for everyone else.
3	B004K55CQ8	This game is really fun but as usual their is always a few certain errors. First of all the programmer didn't bother to adjust the screening to fit the kindle fire. Seccond( and I just think this is my fault) I cannot save any of my characters so this makes me mad but I wish the application or someone would tell me. If you know how please reply!
3	B004K55CQ8	This app is awesome!!!! I do wish that the layout was fullscreen and not as small as a smart phone.
1	B004K55CQ8	This app always says this app has crashed when I try to create a person. I cant believe you all like this dumb app.
3	B004K55CQ8	This is a creative app with many outfits , designs , and more. I think others should try this app.
3	B004K55CQ8	I love it but I keep having problems like it freezes or exits and I don't no if it's the game or my kindle
1	B004K55CQ8	I think it's stupid. All you do is just make your own avatar. That's just gay. Why can't you make your avatar then walk around and meet different avatars.
1	B004K56MNU	Pretty good app
3	B004K56MNU	This app has the most incredible books ever!!everyone should get this app!!!It has choices on what generas you can get its amazing.
3	B004K56MNU	I got this app on my kindle fire and I loved it so much  I got it on my phone.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. I used to be sad that I only could go on the website for wattpad. But now I can without wick. I have my own books. If you like reading or writing than this is the app for you. If you like reading about Harry potter. Vampires. Werewolves. Tern fiction. Fantasy. Action. Horror. Or really any topic that you enjoy to read about. Then his is the app for you. I recommend it. My account has books. Check them out. My books are under the name alexisaho.
3	B004K56MNU	Yes, this app is obviously in a different format than the website, but I never thought it would be the same as it. Great app if you're reading on a mobile device. You do need a source of Internet and/or wifi to use this app. I definitely recommending this app for you. :)
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is a great app that will be worth your time its a great place to make friends, grow as a writer or as a reader and just have good time. You can find anything form romances to BDSM novels its a good site if you like to write :)
3	B004K56MNU	I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS APP!!!!!!!!!! highly recomended. get this app!
3	B004K56MNU	This app is amazing. I write books and read my friends books or some random persons book. I love this app mostly because I want to be an author when I grow up and this app lets me feel what its like to right books. If I could, I would rate this app 10 stars. By the way I'm 14.
3	B004K56MNU	I'm a die hard Directioner. All I read on here is fanfics and they are great. I really love the setup but when you search stuff it bugs out and I hate that because I have to keep doing the search 15,000,000 times
3	B004K56MNU	If you love to read this app is a must have. It has lot of books of all catagories. There is not much to say, you read books that are made by other people. Oh wait, you can also write stories for others to read. You can also comment on other books. Great app for readers.
3	B004K56MNU	Love all the stories I've read and great website to write my own stories. Very resourceful, I love that you can link YouTube to wattpad.
3	B004K56MNU	I first downloaded it on my ipod. I imeadiatly became hooked with the book &quot;Alaska&quot; you can find it in the wherewolf section, and I am currently writing a story. ill post it soon ;) find me under &quot;thelonewolfsoul&quot;happy reading!
2	B004K56MNU	It is a wonderful app for writers and readers alike, nut it crashes as soon as I open it. I ended up just using my browser. If you fix this I will go up to 5 stars.
3	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad, and the kindle allows me to write, read, comment, and vote. Even though I do not like to write without a keypad, others have said they prefer to write on here. Wattpad is a great sight by itself, and the kindle does a great job of displaying it. However, it is difficult to maneuver around.
3	B004K56MNU	I am always looking for places to write and good books to read.  With this app I can read and write and most of the people on here that write are fantastic you just have to be open to the new ideas.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! I go on it daily and if you love to read then this is the app to get!!
3	B004K56MNU	This app is so cool. I can barely get off it. Don't pay attention to all the bad reviews; they're mental.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is amazing and lets you create stories and share them with your friends! It is probably the best story app yet! BUY IT RIGHT NOW, AND YOU WON'T REGRET IT'!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. A lot. Hi. Your eyes are very pretty. And your hair, is a beautiful color. Hi. Get this app. And... Just get it!
1	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad and all the writers and if asked a week ago to review it I would just go on and on this new update stinks doesnt allow for larger print doesn't show update story progress bar where you know how long its going to take to update I started with this new update and 8 hours later and its still refreshing to see if there are updates for any of my books also it keeps saying something happened every time I try to change pages and it says force close or wait I wait then 2 mins later it changes the page I have deleted and redownloaded turn off and on my kindle and wattpad app is just flipping me a bird please please please fix the bugs in the new update and please put the stars on the book that did update I really loved that updates at a glance
3	B004K56MNU	This is a wonderful app for all the people out there that are in love with reading. They are pretty much just books that are made by the people that use the app. You can make your own stories and get followers. Also follow other people that you think their books are good. There  are all types of genres. Mysteries, romantic, fantasy, science fiction, thriller, horror, poems, even fan fiction. (I'm not a huge fan of the fan fiction) but otherwise it la an amazing app for all ages.
3	B004K56MNU	okay so my friend introduced me to this little app. . .  ill admit I'm not much of a money spender in a way. . . so this was a gd app to get. its free and some of the stories are remarkable!!!! You can also write your own stories and have others read them.  I just love this app. :D BRILLIANT!!!!!
1	B004K56MNU	I used to use Wattpad on my laptop before I got my tablet. So, when I realised there was an android app, I downloaded it. It never worked. Not sure if I'm going to bother downloading it again.
3	B004K56MNU	The app is very fun for readers and writers! You can read books that other people have written, and you can write your own. It is a lot of fun, I would recommend it as something to in the morning, before bed, of over the weekend.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is super awesome. I love to read and this is an awesome way to do that!  This app allows people to read awesome books written by others.
2	B004K56MNU	okay well this app isnt that bad if your just looking for a quick story. however i was just looking for a short story but i actually like to read long books and all of the abbreviations and grammar mistakes made them hard to read..
3	B004K56MNU	It works fine on my Kindle Fire and I'm on wattpad all the time and im writting a book!! Oh yeah and plus for all the people who think that the app is for like regular already published books that everybody knows about, it's not it's has books on it that random people write and publish it on the online website. The books are very good and many people are talented all over the world :D
3	B004K56MNU	I think it's a wonderful thing! So many young writers opening up and, well, writing! Its a great way for people to express themselves. People can read so many different stories and get even more writing style ideas. This app is amazing!
2	B004K56MNU	this is a great app for reading the novels and looking at the comments and about the author, but there isn't an option to update your story! and, when I get the books on the Internet, it doesn't show them on the app!
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app.the short stories are amazing the author's have some amazing talent and there is a wide veriety of short stories something for everyone
3	B004K56MNU	This is the best app ever!  Whether you love to write, or just love to read Wattpad is for you!
3	B004K56MNU	This is an awesome app. If anyone was wondering, no, you don't have to make an account to use this app, but it does have it's advantages to have it, and it has little to no disadvantages. If you do have an account, you can save book to your &quot;library&quot; to save for later. You can also get &quot;fans&quot; that can read the books you post and you can become a fan to other people. No, you don't have to get this app, but it's free for one, and for two, it's way easier to tap an app than to type this in the Internet. App works great on my Kindle Fire, no problems at all!Hope this review was helpful!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	As a power of the pen person, after competitions were over, I was stuck writing in filled to the brim notebooks. But I get on the app store, and- ta da! This was recommended. I thank the heavans that I was directed to this. I can write stories (which is the best thing in the world to me) and read some pretty awesome ones, too. I even made some internet friends! It is the best place ever, and I spend most if my time on here. Wanna have people read your story? Get this app. Looking for a new read? Get this app. Think I know what I'm talking about? Get this app. It's free, outstanding, and if you, for whatever reason (I can't think of any) don't like it, just disable the app. You can't go wrong!! :)P.s. I have two people that I suggest following/fanning: raphaelsgurl13 (me!) And judu1234 (my BFF!)BECOME A FELLOW WATTPADIAN TODAY!!
3	B004K56MNU	The watt pad is awesome it works good and there are a lot of good books here for my taste. There are also a lot of new book for me to look at and try it out. u should really get this am so glad I did.
3	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad because it allows me to explore books and stories that are mostly written by teens like me! it also allows people to write at their own pace and without limits of what to write!
3	B004K56MNU	I signed up with Facebook on a different device but can't seem to log in with Facebook on my kindle fire HD. It starts to log in then without me doing anything it cancels the login and reverts back to the starting screen. I found this app to be very well done and is easy to use. It's this minor issue that bugs me.
3	B004K56MNU	I really love wattpad, and I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in delving into the great and creative stories of the people who create these books.
3	B004K56MNU	its a really great app only a little confusing in the beginning but get a hold of it after just a few uses
3	B004K56MNU	I really like this app. This is a good app becouse like I said in the title it helps you get your stories and ideas out in the world.So I do highly reccomend that you download this if you have a story idea you want to share and publish it one day.One more good thing about this app is it allows you to read new stuff everyday.
3	B004K56MNU	This is really brillant, such a lovely idea.For people that are interested in learning how to upload their stories...Wattpad has a book you can download: &#34;WATTPAD FOR DUMMIES&#34;. It not only shows you how to create stories and how to Upload them, but it teaches you everything you might need to know regarding your account. I know this is going to be really useful to a lot of people, because it even shows you how to make your Story available outside Wattpad that you want to Upload for others to read.Personally I think Wattpad is doing a terrific job because I have found some really good reads on here, but there are some that can't write at all unfortunately. These are quite often just normal people that have never written a story before and you can even get notified via Email as when your Favourite Author has uploaded any new stories or chapters that you are reading.You don't even need to open an account with Wattpad to read stories, but you do if you want to upload your own story and you can even connect other accounts to Wattpad; Facebook. Twitter.I have had the App for a number of months now but you can also read the stories on line: Wattpad.comPlus Wattpad is available in other Languages, not just English. I most certainly can recommend Wattpad.***Wattpad describes itself as &#34;the best place to discover and share stories.&#34; It's a YouTube for electronic text stories. The content includes work by undiscovered and published writers. Delivery emphasizes the mobile phone platform, using the free Freda ebook reader. According to Wattpad founder and CEO Ivan Yuen, &#34;marketers can currently upload material for reading by mobile users at no charge&#34;.***Wattpad holds several smaller contests a year and one major one. The large annual contest is called &#34;The Watty Awards&#34; and anyone that has a Wattpad account can enter.There is also an Wattpad gift shop, the place to get all your official Wattpad merchandise, including T-shirts, mugs and stickers. All profit from merchandise sales will go to UNICEF for education and literacy programs for children.cafepress.com/wattpad
3	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad, and have the app lets me read my stories and right them anywhere. Its and amaZAYN app!
3	B004K56MNU	I've been addicted to this site for 2 years! I've never ran out of stories to read! Only thing wrong is the mobile apps, they sometimes tend to be slow and you can't access everything. I like the older versions rather than these new upgrades.
3	B004K56MNU	Love this app for new books.  There is always an amazing author that you stumble upon that is writing something that ends up being printed.  Can't wait for writers to update so that I can continue reading.  Have started reading only completed books to help with the anticipation.
3	B004K56MNU	The first book I am reading is one that was automatically chosen. To my surprise it was one of my favorite genres. To have this much reading material at my fingertips is a real pleasure.
3	B004K56MNU	THIS IS AWESOME! You can look up any book and immediately start reading it. All of the books are free and the wattpad app is free!! :)
3	B004K56MNU	Keeps me up Reading!! Love it! Get it, just get it This is one of the best reading apps i have ever gotten!
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app.  if you are looking for a writing app to share your skills with others, this is the app you should by.  not only can I check my data on the computer, but now I can do it on my kindle to!  I'm so glad Wattpad made an app!  I highly recommend this app to you!
3	B004K56MNU	.I LOVE IT  The idea of this is fun! I just love being able to share my books with everyone who has this. And make sure u look me up my name is SkinnyNerd.
3	B004K56MNU	If you enjoy  reading this is a very good app for you. I really enjoy reading books and its just a great app all together. I have not came in contact with anything bad about the app yet. You should get it ! (:
3	B004K56MNU	I love reading and this gives me the opportunity to read books for free and to write books and let people see!! It's totally amazing and it gives young writers a chance to get out there!!
3	B004K56MNU	This the best reading app I tried writing a few stories they sucked. But now I know I need to work on my writing
3	B004K56MNU	I love to share my stories, and read other peoples stories!! I think the new update is sorta confusing though &gt;&hellip;&lt;
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad allows me to read book on the go and write my own stories anonymously. This also allows me to read other mostly non-published authors.
3	B004K56MNU	I love having this app because I love reading and writing stories. This app is good for bolth. It is a great app to have if you like writing.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is great if you like to find books by regular people who love to write. you can find peoples on versions of famous books or fresh new unknown authors. I would regimens this app to all
1	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad but the newest update made it hard to read, control or even use! Constant errors, haven't read in days! Please fix!!
3	B004K56MNU	This is my favorite app. although I didnt like reading at first I read a little too much because wattpad. started of with reading online now I got the app!!
3	B004K56MNU	While all the stories on Wattpad are not appealing to me and some are not as well written as they could be, the choices are endless and I have found some wonderful things on Wattpad!
3	B004K56MNU	I really LOVE LOVE LOVE Wattpad. There are so many stories on here, so many undiscovered authors, and so many possibilities!! I didn't think  it was all that great when I got it, but then I started reading stories upon stories! Completely worth it to download. And ALSO you can read it when there is no wifi. You don't need wifi to read your books. So you can take your book with you to the beach or where ever. But make sure you search for the books that have been 'completed' because sometimes it may take weeks or a month for an author to update or write the next chapter so you have to wait. I just get the completed one's. :) I love Wattpad!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app so much. whoever says it sucks has problems. I love this app its a good time waster.
3	B004K56MNU	this is the greatest thing to ever happen to my life :)  you can write and read and chat you can get all kinds of fun out of it
3	B004K56MNU	What a great idea, have used this for 4 months now and reading up a storm. Thanks for tis product, works very well.
1	B004K56MNU	I downloaded it to my kindle. I'm looking for real books not short stories, so this didn't work for me. The selection is wide genres but nothing really caught my attention. If your a short story reader this may work for you.
1	B004K56MNU	I found this app to be awful. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you're looking for fanfiction, use the web. It's a much better resource.
3	B004K56MNU	you do not need to make an account to download stories. for those who have a kindle fire and dont have Internet, use public wifi - add stories to your library (many as you like) then when you're home without Internet you can still read them.this is a must have!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. Its a great way to read the stories without having a computer on my lap. I recommend this for any wattpad user!My username- www.wattpad.com/ch12123
3	B004K56MNU	I have an account on wattpad. if you love One Direction, go to my profile, @1Dhelper. I have 6 chapters up. also, if you have a twitter, follow me @1Dhelper.
3	B004K56MNU	I absolutely LOVE it!!! I love how you can upload your own stories and read other people's books as well. It's easy to use and it's awesome as well.
3	B004K56MNU	its so awsome because it as all the different types of gonras in one app. My little cuzzin love it because I read them bedtime story's when time to go to bed. They just love it.
3	B004K56MNU	It's really awesome! You can do so much!  I LOVE reading and If you do too I suggest this! It's sooo awesome!!!! :D
3	B004K56MNU	I love all of the books that it has and you can even write your own book, choose the cover, and read it! I recommend this app to everybody who likes books and loves to read!!
3	B004K56MNU	This app is different but in a great way! It gives you great books for free. And you can make your own books. I read on this site for hours and it gets my imagination working over the summer and every day. Just watch out for the teen books and horror. Don't let your child read those. Otherwise it is amazing! Make more apps like this.
3	B004K56MNU	Very good. I am a wattpad writer (crystallea) and I find it very helpful that I can now write on my mobile. Good place to find new unknown writers. Filled with one direction fan fics and the new chick lit category is great!!! Great app. Keep improving!
3	B004K56MNU	It's awesome! :-) free books and stories. What more can you ask for? I love it. If you really love reading then I recommend this to you.
3	B004K56MNU	I am very happy that wattpad made an app so that I can finally check up on my stories and see what others have posted!
1	B004K56MNU	It's a free app that gives you free e-books.Most of the books are poorly written, and it seems the most popular are teen romance novels (more than a few Twilight fanfics). You can't download them to read in another app, so if you don't like the controls, you're stuck. Plus the formatting is terrible.However, there are a few good stories in here if you're willing to wade through crap. And they are free, after all.
3	B004K56MNU	Oh my goodness I love reading people's work and I'd heard that this was a good app and wow I'm impressed well done
3	B004K56MNU	Great if you love reading book as I do and you can read other people's book I'm stuck on After and  After 2 it is the best books ever !!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	great way to experience new genres and authors- i use it with my students but beware there are some inappropriate reads on it
3	B004K56MNU	I. love this app because even when I'm busy I can still read on the go with this app it helps save time too
3	B004K56MNU	I love love love wattpad. Its such a great avenue for developing writers of all ages. I like how the readers can interact with the writers and vice versa. I'm inspired to start writing again myself :-)
3	B004K56MNU	Great free book app for android tablet, it has far larger selection of free Ebooks that the standard app that was pre-loaded on my tablet. I highly recommend it.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! I love that there are soo many stories and are all FREE! And the best part is that you don't need the internet in order to read them.
3	B004K56MNU	love this app soooo much i read the books on it all day  you should love this app has books from the dead to humans
3	B004K56MNU	This app is a must have for any book lover. There are some amazing writers on here and I must admit I was sceptical of it at first but now I use it all the time. I love and recommend it to anyone and everyone!
3	B004K56MNU	This is my favorite website ever! Writers publish their work by the chapter as ebooks, and you get to read, vote, comment, or write your own. It's addicting, and the best app/website that I've ever stumbled upon. I self publish on Wattpad, and its a great community of readers and writers. Best way to read books online, other than your kindle books ;)
3	B004K56MNU	Grandson felt that the item was a five star except when it glitched out and then it was a four star.  Once again, I cannot give a personal review.  Sorry.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! I have pretty much became addicted to it :) I honestly think it couldn't get better!
2	B004K56MNU	So I got this app because I wanted to write a book and wanted a safe place to store them. Well FAIL. My whole story that was two chapters got deleted when I synced my works. WHYYYYYYY!!! D:
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app , it's relatively fast and easy to use. I also love the new features, it actually notifies you when a story has been updated, a big help.
3	B004K56MNU	A must for new, struggling, or seasoned writers.  Interesting, journeys filled with untold imagination and talent.  The future of literary talent unfolds for all who like to read, write and experience all kinds of stories.
3	B004K56MNU	ok I just wanted to get ur attention with SEX. but anyways this is a great app. and good for reading.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is very amazing if you want to read stories that r about famous people and things that are very original this is for you I couldn't stop reading I'm very hooked actually I'm going to wrap this up to get back to reading
3	B004K56MNU	This is by far my favorite app on my kindle. I'm on it 24/7 and I even have a few stories I'm working on. The people on here are fun and really great writers. I read wattage books more than published books. I'm on for hours at a time. The fact that it's free makes this app a must have for any book lover.
3	B004K56MNU	This app is my life!!! I read it constantly and the amount of story's is endless! The ability to read and post about anything is just amazing and Iove this. My life would shrivel up and die if this app was non-existent. I may be obsessed but its okay. The next book I read ill just become a badass werewolf and pretend lime I have a social life XD
3	B004K56MNU	i get to write stories an some of the books on here are already published an the best part is that its free and the books are amazing because they have different generes i can read 5 books with 50 or more chapters in a week then i continue the process over again.
3	B004K56MNU	no more searching for free books to read. this is amazing. offline i can read books saved on my kindle fire.
3	B004K56MNU	This is an awesome app, I use it to read One Direction fan fictions :) plus, if you save a story to your library, you don't need WiFi to read it!!
3	B004K56MNU	You love to read?.. If yes, then you will love this app.. I have read for the last year or so, and all for FREE!.. I read books that others are creating as we text. The people just starting out I love to read from the most. You just might be reading from someone who will be in the big leagues one day, that alone is a readers thrill.. For all the &quot;Must Haves&quot;, simply fallow my review list up staires, we have nothing but the best for Kindle Fire users.. Enjoy all!!...
3	B004K56MNU	im able to read my fanfictions that i love!!! It's easy to us and save your login. i just love using it!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I LOVE THIS APP. U CAN READ OTHER PEOPLES BOOKS OR WRITE UR OWN. HIGHLY RECCOMENDED FOR PEOPLE WHO LUV BOOKS
3	B004K56MNU	I could waste so much time on Wattpad and having easy access to it just wastes even more of my time now! XDReally great site if you enjoy reading stories by amateur writers. Every type of genera, tons of really fantastic stories, works well in mobile version.
3	B004K56MNU	I really like this app. There are so many great stories. I would definitively recommend this to all my friends. I enjoy this app very much
3	B004K56MNU	This is app is really amazing. What I don't like about it is that you can't view multimedia or post dedications or videos.
3	B004K56MNU	This app is amazing. It allows you to write and publish for others to see, and lets you read other peoples work. I haven't been able to stop using this since ive gotten this. highly reccomended for readers and writers
3	B004K56MNU	I am a full hearted bookworm, so this is perfect. Although half the story are clich&eacute; love stories, they're still fun to read. The fact that you're able to create and upload your own works makes it that much more great.  I recommend this app/website to anybody who loves to read/write.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is absolutely incredible. It allows writers to be creative and express their writing ability to the world. The fun thing is, you can write whatever you want. It's also a great app for readers. There are many stories to choose from, you're sure to find something you like. All of the writers on Wattpad are very skilled, so you'll at least enjoy something! Think about it, it's free stories to read! Even installing the application is of no cost! I wouldn't think twice about getting this app!
3	B004K56MNU	I looooove wattpad. Been a member for years now and got it on my kindle so I could reread some of my favorite stories while in bed. A lot of great authors and stories on here just waiting to be discovered. If you haven't tried wattpad yet, I suggest you do it now. Seriously.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. It allows u to read old authors of famous books or u can read books unfounded and see how amazing they are.. to be honest not all the books are amazing because they are made by people but it's still awesome
3	B004K56MNU	It is a really great app. You can read stories that have already been published by actual authors or read stories by future authors. You can even write and create your very own stories!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	Exactly what the title says. I think that the app Is great since you can read offline but you can only add stories to your library and not you're reading list. Plus you can't even look at someone else's page unless they're following or followers. You can't follow either
1	B004K56MNU	I have used wattpad on my phone for years and I used to love it. With their new and improved version, you can no longer read offline and even when trying to read while online it is so glitchy, it is impossible to get through a book. I finally gave up and no longer use this app. Even if they fix the horrible glitches, what good is it if you can't use it offline on a tablet? I want to be able to continue reading whatever story I am in the middle of no matter where I am.
3	B004K56MNU	My daughter love watt pad and it makes her read more than every. It has a lot of different things to read. I think every child should be able to read story  and enjoy them.  Now she wants to write a story book as well.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is awesome I love it.  this is the BEST app ever I am obsessed with fanfictions. this is a great app for upcoming wrighters.
3	B004K56MNU	love it!  now insted of reading my  wattpad books on the small screen of my ipod i can read on here and the text is bigger so it dose not mess with my eyes.
3	B004K56MNU	I first found this app for my Ipod. When I recieved my Kindle Fire, this app was the first one I downloaded. Able to sync across devices, great looking bookcover artwork, easy search engine, nice book descriptions.I like the app due to authors continuing writting their books and updating them on Wattpad. Besides new writters, there are established writters on this site.Its a well organized search engine for different genres. Download this app and use it!
2	B004K56MNU	I tried it and then deleted the icon as it was not what I expected or needed.  Not saying it was bad or anything like that but not for me.  Please try it yourself as it may be what your looking for
3	B004K56MNU	Even though I don't have the update I love how u can search UP any book u like. It so cool
3	B004K56MNU	Although I get a lot of my books from the kindle store Wattpad has a lot of interesting books to read for free, which is the best part. A lot of the books are for teenagers which is good for a kid who likes to read, and as an adult I've found books that interest me. So thumbs up for this app.
3	B004K56MNU	If you like reading and writing get this app! You get to hear other people's opinions on your writing which is very helpful if you want to know how good you are and if you have a chance to be a writer. I love it! Expect I really really wish that you could get some books you made somewhere else and put it on there on a Kindle Fire. And of you don't like this then don't get it! It's a great app, and if you get the right books you might get addicted to it sometimes. Good books are like&ldquo;Shoot. And. Score. My. Ass.&quot; ummm and &ldquo;Payne in the ass&quot; and those two books are still getting updated it's an app so if you do like writing or reading and wanna have opinions ob your books get it!
3	B004K56MNU	My friend go me hooked on wattpad and now i can't stop reading book and wrighting my book it is great.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! its really nice because even if the work is really bad I can still use it which makes this app really easy to use
3	B004K56MNU	This app provides Wattpad wherever there Wi-Fi. You can write your own story or read other's from your reading library. Quick, fun, and easy.
1	B004K56MNU	The app downloads. I open it. I search a topic. I click &quot;more&quot; to see more search results and it guess back to the home page. I have re downloaded at least 10 times. Same thing happens each time
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is a great way to pass time and let young readers to practice their writing. I love the books the people post on here and it is a really exciting and fun app once you get started.
3	B004K56MNU	I really enjoy this app..you can actually not get bored reading and its written by mostly people that are teenagers and its more entertaining..plus unlimited word choice lol..but warning some stuff is graphic bit they have to warn you at the beginning of a chapter..Btw my username sis Jasaloves101 check my book out!!
3	B004K56MNU	I think this app is amazing for when you're traveling and you don't exactly feel like logging in online (even though you have to log in if you want your private library). I think anybody who loves to read as much as I do should getvthis. You need Internet connection though.
3	B004K56MNU	This is a great app for anyone who loves to read or write. The only downsides are occasional bad writers or aloe updates.

1	B004K56MNU	It never would do anything for me. Would not let anything work for me. I have no idea why? Thus, it is deleted.
3	B004K56MNU	I've enjoyed this app. There are good stories to be found and the site is easy to navigate. I would recommend this app to others for those who enjoy fan fiction and the work of amateur authors. There is a variety of skill here but there are definitely very good writers here.
3	B004K56MNU	I can read books and share with others, also while reviewing and commenting on parts or the whole book. I was referred by an author to beta read for her, and it works great. I hear you can even write your own book on wattpad. I'm very pleased!
3	B004K56MNU	Love this app so much easier to get to the story I am wanting as long as I have it in my library
3	B004K56MNU	I found this app to be amazing. It lets you find books people like you and me wrote plus you can write your own and publish it online. I absolutely love it.
3	B004K56MNU	I love to write storys i mean they may nit be good but i still like to.I wish i could say something bad about it but its just plain awesome.If you want to be an author this is the perfect place to start.I'm happy i got this app and i hope ill see some new writers getting this app.  This is the app for me i don't know about you but if you like to write you'll love this app.  I hope this review helps you make a decision to get this app. I f you don't like to write I'm not saying this app is bad but you wont like it only people who like to write and read will like this app. Even if you dont want to write you can always just read.ReboBarMoon
3	B004K56MNU	Good app to read free books. Now these books are written by everyday average people. Some are super short and others very long. You have a long list of categories to choose from and you can even specify completed stories.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. it has lots of books on it that people around the world wrote. it has different genres ranging from chick lit/ romance to horror/ spiritual. this app is great for people interested in writing books to.
3	B004K56MNU	so it has a few bugs, so what. For those of you who fated it low, first of all, its for people to write their own stories. What did you expect! Four-hundred paged novels? Yeah right. The good books get published. Its here for people to write and get their books out for free to be read and sometimes publish. Shut up and be nice. its a great app, just needs some help. THANK YOU WATTPAD DESINGERS, TECHNITIONS, AND REVIEWERS FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK! WE APPRECIATE IT!
3	B004K56MNU	I have been using wattpad over a year. it has become the only app I use to read books. I never run out of books to read. give it a try. I only read the completed books.
2	B004K56MNU	If you start reading a book and then accidentally back out of it to the menu then go back to the book you end up at the start of the book and have to hunt for the page you were on.
3	B004K56MNU	Although my time rarely gives me a chance to read, i recommend it to the book worms especially if its the whole book.
3	B004K56MNU	ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THEIR ARE INTELEGENT AND VERY GOOD TEEN WRITERS LIKE ME IF YA LOVE A GOOD AND RICH SRORY DOWNLOAD WATTPAD!!
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is a great reading app. It has A LOT of books! The cool thing is you get all books for free:-) I recommend you getting this app. If you like to read then this is a great app for you! PPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSS get it!!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I think its a very good app. it has books for a wide veriety by a wide veriety. I reccomend this app for your tablet or smartphone.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is a wonderful place to read stories wrote by people who haven't been published. Not all of the stories are wonderful, but that is to be expected. The app is wonderful for finding stories to read from any category. It's the most used app on my kindle.
3	B004K56MNU	This is an amazing app. Love the books that I find. Allows you to read books written by other people and you could also write your own books. In my opinion it's a great app I experience no problems, pretty easy to use.
3	B004K56MNU	I have been using this app to read great stories from amateur writers and write my own.  It's a great tool to help you get started writing, and there's always good authors posting content to keep you interested.
3	B004K56MNU	It keeps track of where I am in the books I read on Wattpad and it alerts me when a new chapter has been uploaded.  I like that I can increase the text size I just wish it was a tad bigger...it would be nice to read without the glasses which is the reason I use a kindle to begin with...lol...
3	B004K56MNU	I love it. you can look up anything like Justin bieber books.  I read a lot of books on there by other people. all u people that write those book keep going I love them.
3	B004K56MNU	This is a good app. I am a big writer so I thought you get to create your own stories. But, you have to log on to facebook, and I don't have a facebook account. Also, a lot of people think it is free books made by authors by Erin Hunter or some one else. If you think that, your WRONG! The books are made by people on facebook.This is a good app though.
3	B004K56MNU	I use this app and my friends use the website. its a great way to read good books n create your own. I would suggest it to anyone who likes to read and/or write :)
1	B004K56MNU	this sucks cause it lets people search you and find you!!! this sucks. wattpad sucks!  I hate this and I dint even log in and it gave me an account.
3	B004K56MNU	really great app if you prefer to not go to the browser. Works great on my kindle fire. You should get this if you have a wattpad account (or create one)
3	B004K56MNU	It has a lot of stories that I like.  It has a variety of different types of stories.  I like getting on wattpad when I'm bored.
3	B004K56MNU	This is a great app for when your curious tobsee other people's talent for writing and you want to know just how competitive the writing world can be. Hundreds of stories, all made by local people (some better than others) and yet it's as if they should've been published. Totally recommend this, it's worth the time.P.S. I recommend your first read should be Red Leather (cover of a girl w/ red lipstick)
3	B004K56MNU	I l o v e t h i s a p p I l i k e t o b e a b l e t o r e a d o n t h e g ob
2	B004K56MNU	I would recommend having your child's password and keeping an eye on all their chats (which cannot be turned off) and what books they are reading and so forth.  But they can just easily create a new account that you may not know about.  If wattpad would require a valid email verification that would not happen.  Also make it possible to read stuff only if they put it in their library and make that password protected.  Simple.
3	B004K56MNU	wattpad is an amazing app, especially when you get to read a book written by a talented author! love it
3	B004K56MNU	I have been a Wattpad fan for several years, especially for discovering new or first-time authors. This app does not let me down!  I highly recommend it.
3	B004K56MNU	not a lot of apps these days will give creative uses to us through art of all kinds I enjoy to use my skill and so many others to
3	B004K56MNU	A must have for those who dream to be authors. Not only that but a great way to see what others are reading. I absolutely love this app, although you can't see backgrounds for profiles it's perfect. Take my word for it, you'll love it.
3	B004K56MNU	LOVE IT!!! It's the best.  I not only get free books to read but I get a chance to read the writings of some awesome writers that are up and coming.  Its the best of both worlds for me.
3	B004K56MNU	This app has great story's of all genre. It is easy too use and I have only had a few problems but other than that it has been great.
3	B004K56MNU	Okay first I accidently reported someones I'm so sorry! BUT I LOVE this app! I'm addicted to it! I can read books from really great authors and I can even make my own! RECOMMENDED TO EVERYONE!
3	B004K56MNU	this is such a cool app, you can write your own stories and read some too! how cool is dat??? GET IT!!! :D

3	B004K56MNU	Who says it sucks? This is an AWSOME app that you don't need WI-FI for! I'm writing my own book, Shifters, and the app is great I love it.
3	B004K56MNU	so many fanfictions and very easy to use. you can write your own stories easily and people will vote and comment and such. i absolutely love this app.
3	B004K56MNU	ive been searching for free book reading on my kindle fire and I came across this app and I cant believe how many free creative writers are out there. this is s must get app for free reading. 5stars+
3	B004K56MNU	I think this app is wonderful. Now I can work on my stories on the computer and on my kindle! Great concept and awesome stories and fanfictions.
3	B004K56MNU	great app for great books. i am also very glad that you can read saved stories without any internet  connection!
3	B004K56MNU	This is awesome! I spend all my time on on Wattpad, reading and writing my story.WARNING: if you have a life, don't get this. It's addicting if you love reading and/or writingIf you don't, get it anyways!~MadisonBTW, my username is madiliz19. Look me up!
3	B004K56MNU	This is THE app every teen needs. It has as many stories as I'll ever need, and I have more than 300 books in my library and have read at least 100 of them. They are great books, and some of the books in the Amazon store that cost money are on WATTPAD for free (at least the cloud prophecy trilogy is).Favorite Wattpad Books/Series/Authors-&#8226;Forever and Always His (RiceLover) &#8226;Late Summer Rain (AubreyEatsHearts) &#8226;Forever Yours (BeautifulRose16) &#8226;Fearless (UnicornFartGlitter) &#8226;Love is Blind (TaraLDeclan) &#8226;There's a Thin Line Between Love and Hate (MP3Girl) &#8226;FROST (ELatimer) &#8226;The Shy Girl Has a Gun (makeandoffer) &#8226;Toy Soldiers (RileyTeagan) &#8226;IvoryAuthor &#8226;XxSkater2Girl16xX &#8226;mamie1990
3	B004K56MNU	so great no words to describe k ok am I sure yes I'm sure.luv all the stories Kk bye I guess......
3	B004K56MNU	This is a fantastic way for young New writers to get put there even if you are not sure you wanna become an author this is a great opportunity for you too. It's simple you write your story and publish it people can review and decide if they like it themselves it's also free definitely worth the time you can also look at what others wrote too. And if your story is really good they might broadcast it!!
3	B004K56MNU	This is a great app for reading stories, it worked fine on my kindle there were no problems so I recommend this app to you! :)
3	B004K56MNU	I liked wattpad before, then all it would do was force close when I tried to read a story. Very Annoying!With update, all is working properly again. Might even be better.  TY to All writers,  keep it up!
3	B004K56MNU	THIS is a GREAT app. I LOVE IT. By the way, how do you publish books if you have a kindle. Keep up the good work guys.
2	B004K56MNU	Good read for short stories. Gave it only 3 stars because I made the mistake of choosing a long one and there is no way to bookmark a page. Always went back to beginning at log in.....very tiresome.
3	B004K56MNU	I totally love it!!! I don't have to be connected to the internet to access the stories that are in my library online. I use this app on my both my Kindle Fire HD 7 and my LG android phone. I'm addicted to this app!!!
2	B004K56MNU	this app worked perfectly on my BlackBerry but the new version STOP working on my Kindle Fire! ! it brings all the paragraphs together and crashes EVERY TIME i use it in this. PLEASE PUT IT BACK TO LAST VERSION BECAUSE I CANT USE PROPERLY AND I LOVE WATTPAD!  I LOVE THIS APP BUT IT SUCKS RIGHT NOW. PLEASE FIX ITTTT! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I LOVE THIS APP!!! I have to down loaded  it again because.  Accidentally deleted it): u can choose over a vampire to fanfic and so on I hoped I helped you. You won't regret this app
3	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad so much! I got this app on my Kindle because I wanted wattpad on the go, cuz I can't bring my laptop everywhere! My account is donut1122 but if you can't find that user try Vixenfang_Warrior. I love the warriors series by Erin Hunter, so most of my books are on that series! This app unlocked my true writing potential and I even made a friend! The only thing I don't like is you can't see a person's background, previous comments left on books, who's reading your book, and it glitches a bit!! But I truly do love this app and highly recommend it to all the writers out there. Even if you aren't much of a writer now, this app will slowly improve your writing skills. And who knows?Maybe you'll even get your books published someday!!
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad - AMAZING. Basically, if you're a really true-to-yourself writer, than Wattpad is the place to get discoverd! Thousands of people read your book, and give feedback on how awesome it is! Though, I dont post stories of my own, becuase I don't want people stealing my ideas.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is for those who really love to read and want to create their own stories,it gives you a so much to choose from love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	This app is wonderful. You may want to create an account though. If you do not you can still read , but you can not message people and there is a possiblly that it will not save the stuff you read. I love it and sugget you get it.
1	B004K56MNU	i have been a wattpad user for close to a year now. i just came across the app recently and thought how useful it would be but all it does is slow me down. It doesnt tell me when i have a message, when i follow someone back and doesnt show it on my profile but theirs, and hard to get used to for me. I have talked to my followers and they have problems with it too.
3	B004K56MNU	I WAS A AUTHOR TRYING TO FREEWRITE NOW I CAN GET FAME SLYFOX 12 look me up:) word word word word
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app it is amazing to read all of These stories. And if you want to write your own story it is really easy. There are so many amazing stories!!
3	B004K56MNU	I LOVE IT :D. ITS SO PERFECT AND I LIVE HOW IT AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES. ITS PERFECT AND I LOVE IT. ITS ONE OF MY FAV. APPS AND ITS INCREDIBLE HANDS DOWN TO READ WITHOUT INTERNET. ITS PERFECT
3	B004K56MNU	its cool because I can read the fanfics and stories that I love and write my own. it works better then the interbreeding version on my kindle fire!:)
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app.  I'm a big fan of fanfiction and there are lots of stories by amatures out there.  I can find hundreds of stories.  I highly recommend this app.
3	B004K56MNU	I love wattpad alot. But I really hate the way they set it up now when you're searching for books.I can't see if it's complete without spending 5 minutes on a single book. I can't  get more options on my search. I think I like the older version better than the newer one.I don't like having to go onto the website all the time just to find a complete story to read. I hope they update really soon.That's my only complaint. I think people should definitely get a wattpad and start writing more. Wattpad is really great, especially for newbie writers who might need advice or are just writing for the fun of it.
3	B004K56MNU	This is a great reading APP or if you just want to talk so good you can talk to me at Jalexis12345
3	B004K56MNU	The same books you find on Amazon you will find here. Amazing stories you will find here. You can find complete books or chapters of books that are not finished but this app will let you know when there are new chapters and if a book has spelling or grammar issues or if there is something off with the book, let them know they will fix it and let you know when it has been corrected.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is a great app for any book reader or writer. Anyone that's looking for a any type of book you can find it on Wattpad. I am an author ( although i have huge writer's block at the moment) and an avid reader. It's my favorite app. I get on everyday and read do many stories. Since i joined in April, i have over 211 stories in my Library alone. Not to mention the other 400 in my other reading list. It truly is a great app.
3	B004K56MNU	If your into reading and writing your own stories this app is for you! It kinda reminds me of myspace the way everyone fills out there profile. Lots of teens on here. But great for all types of writers.

3	B004K56MNU	Great app,  Stories are different and you can offer feedback to the authors.  My thanks to the developers of this app.
3	B004K56MNU	its like so so so so so helpful. ive always enter an app like this. if ur on Wattpad, follow me Ervin Landon or look upA Lonely Boy: Ervin E. Landonhelp me reach my goal of best book:) it would b my dream. Thank u love this app :)
3	B004K56MNU	You get to Wright your own stories an read other people's stories. It  good for people who are bad at spelling. Like me and I love this app . You should get it . It fun for all
3	B004K56MNU	you write your own story or read stories. Most books and people get discovered its such a great app. love this app so much
3	B004K56MNU	I loveeeee this app. I'm addicted to this app. Its an app for unpublished writers. Mostly teens and adults up to 25. I like it
3	B004K56MNU	this the second best way to hands down. the first best is a actial book. bit this is a grest way to on the go too. i love it!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I absolutely love the app if you like reading get it. period. if your a hoping out for new and upcoming artist trust me this isn't just a bunch of kids writing crappy stories, this is the beginning of a writer, this is where some start. and ive heard some of these stories getting published, so this is the real deal
3	B004K56MNU	okay I got this thinking it would be werid but when I got it I realizer this is really cool you NEED to get this its so cool and creative
3	B004K56MNU	Honestly, its a great app.  However it's a hassle to type a story on it because my keyboard on my tablet is terrible. It's great for reading stories though. This app has potential but it just won't be the same as logging on through the computer. -@Constellations101 &lt;-- My Wattpad user name
3	B004K56MNU	find great book that people are still working on and i still get into them and wait to the wittier puts up the new parts of the book
3	B004K56MNU	True, you do have to browse around for a good story, and there is a possibility that a good author will want actual money for their book and remove it from the ap. But this is a way to read countless books FOR FREE and encourage talented authors in their writing. The fanfiction section is a vast wasteland of teenyboppers writing about their crushes, but all the other sections have worthwhile stories.Just keep the price in mind, pay attention to how much applause a story has and you will love it. Ah, one more thing. This is NOT an ap for kids. There are adult stories in the archive.
3	B004K56MNU	Any genre and many books to choose from with good amateur and pro writers and all for free! It's great seeing so many willing to share their story for others to enjoy plus the willingness to get feedback. I think it's a great tool for those that want to explore the field of writing to hone their talents. I really enjoy the ability to escape into a good story anytime without worry of charge. All I need is my Kindle and/or laptop, internet, and Wattpad and I'm set. I've been a Wattpad member now for 10 months and am so glad I stumbled upon it. I don't know what life would be like without it anymore, yes I do...boring! Thank you to the creators of Wattpad, I love it!
2	B004K56MNU	my couisin told me that these were remakes of old books, so Im starting with a three star. and id rather bite my finger.
3	B004K56MNU	This is one of the best apps I ever used you can text your friends look at New books and even you can make  New ones it's a great app people who say that it is bad don't believe them it's a great app
3	B004K56MNU	I really like this app and I love how it let's me create stories and such. It also keeps the stores I read in a nice order. I really highly suggest this app.
1	B004K56MNU	I cant even explain how horrible this app is i mean it is all of the books were about sluts and sex and there was not one decent book that they had to get that was appropriate and on top of all that they dont even give u the whole book they just have the first part of itv and then right when it gets good they just leave  u hanging so yayh unless u like sex scens DON'T BUY!!!!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	I discovered wattpad awhile ago, and fell in love with it! Its the best reading site ever! My names Alexis Schwarz? And I write fanfics! Follow me and read my fanfics BROKENand NIALLS SUMMER LOVEand LIFE ALWAYS GETS BETTER. Peace out Homedawgs. &lt;3
3	B004K56MNU	love the app
3	B004K56MNU	It's really good. You can easily read some books, share some notes and share your opinion. That is great !
3	B004K56MNU	I have been a member of many writing sites, and let me just tell you!...Not only is it awesome Wattpad has it's own app, but it is easy to compose stories. It also has a &quot;cover&quot; feature, which other sites do not AND the quality, quantity and genres surpass all other writing sites!I highly recommend Wattpad!To writers and readers!Even if you don't write, reading these unknown authors is immensely refreshing!You can even put the stories you like into your own &quot;library&quot; feature and follow their authors, of whom are very appreciative of your support and &quot;votes&quot; at the end of each chapter!Check Wattpad out!I assure you, from one who is very picky about these writing/reading sites, you will not be disappointed!Don't forget to download the FREE Wattpad app. for easier access!Enjoy!  Hope to see you there!Sharylfriendp (Second Chances ; author)  :)
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! It's very easy to use and is very well organized. This app is perfect for people who love to read.
3	B004K56MNU	For years I have been looking for a place to share all my awesome stories that I have thought of, and now I've found it. Plus I can read really cool and awesome stories too. It's an awesome place for young authors to share their creativity. Who said playing on your electronic device was bad, especially if your reading and writing stories! Get this app. It fun, and your parents will be proud of you during this app.
3	B004K56MNU	Love this app it's allow my to read stories and many wonderful stories from many different people and all kind of good stories.
3	B004K56MNU	This app gives you a lot of short stories and books free. I really like it and have enjoyed reading it.
3	B004K56MNU	I don't know if I am old enough because I am only 9 and the books looked like they were for adults but I have been on this website before and someone told me to get off of this website immidiatly.
3	B004K56MNU	I was turned on to this by a friend and now I'm hooked there are so many talented writers. Im reading a couple stories and they have me stuck! in a good way
3	B004K56MNU	I love the site, it's a great place to write and upload my stories. (My username is Skanea)There's a few problems, like if you change your photo it says it changes but never loads.They're small problems, though. Still an excellent app and site.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is so fabulous! When you get it read my stories This May Be Love, The Black Rose, and The Snow Queen by SkylaWaters.
1	B004K56MNU	i love wattpad don't get me wrong, but i can't  log on with the version on amazon, i have no prob with the one on android market. I have the same problem on my mytouch.  this is an issue for me because I keep a reading list of all the stories I'm reviewing.  an earlier version of this app did not have this issue.
3	B004K56MNU	This would be a great app but there are a few things that are disappointing. The first thing is that you can't make your own cover. Second, you can't make a reading list on your profile. Third, as far as I can tell you can't change your username.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app. fun - free - interesting - weird incompleate finished short stories novels cliffhangers free plenty of sci fi zombies love
3	B004K56MNU	Its really nice to read a book on a free app instead of paying two dollars for like one book!! The books are really awesome
3	B004K56MNU	Read free books by emerging authors! It's easy to browse for books and you can save the ones that look interesting for later.
3	B004K56MNU	The Kindle Fire app is almost better than the actual online site. It's clear, its fast, and it shows your library, profile, and books created, which you can edit. You can write from it, publish, check your stories' votes/reads/comments, edit your profile, send messages to your fans, update your status, read other's books as well as comment, vote and add them to your library, and fan your favorite authors as well as check out their profiles. Its compatible, and has almost NEVER had technical failures. The reading is spectacular- your can change the font, brightness of your device's screen for reading, size of font, the color (white[black type], parchment[beige &amp; brown], and black[white type]) , as well as a scrolling option where the story continues to scroll as you read without you having to touch the screen. This option even lets you go at your own pace. I've downloaded 60-70 books on here, and there have been no crashes, no failures. Its just plain awesome. There are thousands of books available for reading, in several wide ranges of genres as well as a helpful search for finding books to read. You must, unfortunately but obviously, be online to download books or publish chapters of your own books, but here's my favorite part about the ENTIRE app; YOU CAN READ WITHOUT INTERNET. Yes!!! You have to have already downloaded the book to your library, but after that- you're home free. You can read ANY book in your library wherever, whenever. No Wi-Fi required. Amazing, right? I love this app and recommend it towards any unpublished authors and dedicated readers or Wattpadians. Useful, simple, bugless, and sparkingly wonderful. I'd give it about eighty stars if I could. Til then, we'll stick with 5. 100% satisfaction.
3	B004K56MNU	This app allows you to live your dream of publishing a book and allowing people to interact. Also you can read a lot of incredible books on here. You can learn from others stories and you can give them your opinion. This app is definitely worth it. WARNING: addiction may occur
3	B004K56MNU	I love that its free, that its easy and I love reading what normal people have to write. its a fly cool app and I highly recommend it.
3	B004K56MNU	best app ever have not had any problems! its a brilliant app that's all I can really say;) no troubles or cloches.
3	B004K56MNU	I love reading books on here they are sooo good thAnks to my bestie she told me about this app I love to read nd to be able to read stories that's is sooo good
1	B004K56MNU	I have not used this app, so I really have nothing to say about it either way.  I found it hard to deal with.
3	B004K56MNU	Its amazing that after so long I finally have a way for people to rate my books that I write 5/5
3	B004K56MNU	I'm a Wattpad Member has been for a while! I love Wattpad and using a app to read stories is better than going to the actual site! But of course, I still go to the site to make my own stories! Lot's of people who like to read should get this!
2	B004K56MNU	To be honest, Wattpad sucks on the Kindle Fire. The website itself is excellent 100%, but the Fire has limited abilities while using the app. Such as, the functionality of the app itself is horrible. You cannot scroll through the stories yourself, it is continuously scrolling by itself and you have to constantly change the speed of it so you can actually read. Other than that, the Wattpad app is OK.
3	B004K56MNU	good app. use quite a bit.  great for reading non-kindle friendly books.  also includes a search for books. esp nice if you like classics or open domain books.
3	B004K56MNU	I recently got a Wattpad account after hearing about it from my cousin and love the website.  The app is a great help because I can download books whenever I have wi-fi and the library updates automatically whenever books are added on other devices or when the authors post new chapters.  I would recommend this to everyone, even if you don't have a Wattpad account.And, if you're ever in need of a book to read, look for Princess of Pandoria, found on Wattpad.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app! I've been spending over half my time reading and writing books on here, and its a great way to get your creative mind out there!
3	B004K56MNU	i first got the website from my sister and i fell in love something for everyone!i have been using this website for years
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is amazing, obviously. You get to make your own stories and share it to millions, maybe billions of people. These are all written by people like you, and it's really fun! I just wish there was a book cover maker. The stories are easy to write and it's very compatible with the kindle. There are many brilliant authors, one could be you. Just try it out, and you'll figure everything out and have an amazing time!&raquo;&raquo;&raquo; If you have time, please read some of my stories @kkris_adhi. I'm still writing but I love to make stories, so check it out!!
3	B004K56MNU	This app lets you read books for FREE. There is a huge variety, and you can even read new writer's books. It lets you write your own book, which I'm doing. No disappointments at all. GET THE APP.
3	B004K56MNU	If you like writing or reading stories, then you better buy this app RIGHT NOW. It's amazing. It has free books poems, and even some horror stories. And the real plus is, the app is free!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1	B004K56MNU	Don't download cause it won't let u sign up with Facebook and it froze when I tried signing up with e-mail and I had to restart my kindle do not download cause you'll have to restart your kindle (maybe)
3	B004K56MNU	I love this app it keeps me up to date on all my fave fabrics its ease to understand and great for late night reading
3	B004K56MNU	Yea you guys are liars, the update was great, and works flawlessly on my kindle fire hd.  Follow @jordyn_roselove and read my books
3	B004K56MNU	I found this site on Google chrome as an application. When I found it here as well, I was thrilled. It has so many stories to read and you can write your own as well.
3	B004K56MNU	this app is awesome! I have it on my kindle and I just absolutely love it! get this app! :)
3	B004K56MNU	This app is the best on my kindle.NO CRASHES.I can stay on this one app for hours.Great for new writers and/or creative people.
1	B004K56MNU	There are many sorry stories here but they are difficult to read how the set up is for scrolling with the books.
3	B004K56MNU	It's just like using it on the internet but looks a little different, you can still read books and make stories. I think it's better than using the browser but like when I copy and paste I can't do big paragraphs the little white stop goes away for me at least. I have a kindle and when I use Wattpad on the browser I can't do bold letters and italics but on the app I can so I'd use both. Oh and I don't have background on the app so I can't change it from the app, if that makes sense.
3	B004K56MNU	I was already an avid reader of wattpad before I got the app. But now I can't seem to put it down! The updates take some getting use to, but it's very much worth it!
3	B004K56MNU	I love reading. With this app I can read dozens of books absolutely free! The books are well writen and very interesting. I also liked the fact you can browse certain catagories. And it is so much more handy to hsve an Wattpad app than going on the web all the time. So far it has not forse closed on me once! Keep up the great work!
3	B004K56MNU	Love wattpad on my kindle fire but I would love wattpad on my kindle paperwhite could u please have it available on paper white that would be beautiful like natural paper :)
3	B004K56MNU	I'm not sure how to put my finished works up but I love the books! this is a great app for readers and writers! I have three more words for you. GET. THIS. APP.Thank you~Megan1
3	B004K56MNU	I love Wattpad online, and to have it on my Kindle t  work on my story on the go is wonderful.
3	B004K56MNU	I love this I write and write and write all the time to my story &amp;#34;My life in a jar&amp;#34; anyone on wattpad should follow me!. I got my sister into it also.! This app let's you read other people's imagination or reality and gives you ideas on your own. I personally think that this app has the extra flavor to it that only watt pad users would get. I say YES DOWNLOAD FOR THE READERS READING THIS!!!!
3	B004K56MNU	it has a bunch of really stupid books and one direction books which im not a biig fan  :/ other wise good.
3	B004K56MNU	I have the wattpad app on my cell phone, i-pod and now on my new Kindle fire.  I you love to read or write you need to have this app. Wattpad rocks...
3	B004K56MNU	This app works wonderfully in keeping you up to date with whatever you are following on wattpadd. I enjoy the ease of use and the ability read or know when authors have done updates on their stories. As an author myself this is a great site to share writings with readers who want to have some affect on the outcome of your writing. Enjoy!
3	B004K56MNU	I absolutely love this app. I love that I can make my own books and read the books other people made. I can also publish them for others to read.
3	B004K56MNU	This app is so good, where do I begin?Well, I must start off by saying that you need WiFi. Sigh. The only downside of this otherwise wonderful app!Anyways, if you do have WiFi, you can browse a wonderful selection of fantastically organized books. If you want to write books, you can sign up for a free Wattpad account. If you do, search MoonlightDash (that's me).
3	B004K56MNU	I don't really like reading, but now that I have been using this app I do! There is sooo many genres to choose from, And people that are your age could be writing them. You can write, too! Overall, this is just a great app and I am using a kindle-fire and it hasn't crashed...So...Get Wattpad!(:
3	B004K56MNU	I'm currently using the kindle fire HD and I cannot login with my Facebook account anymore and I forgot my password when I log in on the pc it says reverify account but I never received email please help I am at a standstill... using heartland app other devices is not a problem
3	B004K56MNU	It's a very awesome app. You can read the stories that you have added to your library without internet but you need internet for everything else
2	B004K56MNU	The new update Sucks when searching for something new to read. I like the last layout a LOT better. I hope you guys plan on changing it soon.
3	B004K56MNU	Wattpad is an amazing app, I love that the authors can be anybody-not just already famous authors. I found very good books and short stories, not to mention wonderful ideas. I recommend to everyone of all ages.
3	B004K56MNU	You should get this app if yo  like to read or write stories or even both an  share them with lots and lots of people I gave it a shot anyway it's free you know what they say if it's free it's for me .
3	B004K56MNU	This app is the BEST! I'm not it 24/7 and up there is my username! I cannot get off this website/app! All must get unless you hate books and writing and think you're too cool for it. By the way, if that's you, you're not cool at all because you don't sound smart. This app is so freaking great!
3	B004K56MNU	Great for book lover's like me. You read stories from aspiring authors and rate and give feed back to them.
3	B004K594X0	I've been using this app for several months now. The effects are fabulous! You can preview them after you take your shot to decide on the best look. So many effects! I have my favorites and stick with those. The vintage shots are fun for re-creating those family photos. I only wish that I could view previews of the effects online first, but a very minor gripe. Great app worth the $.
3	B004K594X0	The only thing I'd like to see added would be touch point autofocus. If HTC, Samsung, and others can do it it's possible. That being said it doesnt stop me from using this daily.
3	B004K594X0	Hands down the best camera app for Droid that the devs continuously work to improve on.  i purchased the full version about a year ago on the Android Market and just want to let Amazon app shoppers know that they will not be disappointed.  Developers are fantastic w/ customer support, too.
3	B004K594X0	Well the answer is...Kind of.lets get to the point the reader probably wants to know if its worth the money buying this not-to-cheap app, as you may have seen the 5 star rating the answer is: ABSOLUTELY!... however...(suspense music) I have to point to very small and minor points: It would be great to have a preview of the picture while applying the effects because this tool is so flexible customizable and has so many great effects which turn you in a professional picture editor that sometimes it takes more time than desired to get the effect you want, this is actually annoying when you are new to the app. Anyway the names of the effects are mostly accurate in telling you what it is , therefore is in most part temporal minor issue.List of cool things of this app:so many effectsYou can customize the effects in many waysThere are many ways to take your picture (the best for my Xperia play is the fact that you can take a good shoot with the "R" button which makes it feel likes real camera.)It has a handy assortment of framesGood and intuitive interfaceAnd much more!in conclusion this app is worth every penny and more!!!
3	B004K594X0	Excellent stock camera replacement for your Android phone. Many lenses and options are available to suit your personal style. The shortcut feature is great for saving a style and access on the fly. Well worth the cost.
3	B004K594X0	running on LG g2x.  works great.  the pictures come out looking much better than when using the stock application.  I would go as far as to say they are better than when snapping with my Nikon point and shoot but not as good as my Nikon D7000.  either way,  i highly recommend this application if you really want to leverage your phones camera,especially if your phone has a nice camera.
3	B004K594X0	Great photography app.  Lots of options with explanations of effects.  It really makes taking pics fun.  I almost don't want to ever bring my SLR when I have my phone now!
3	B004K594X0	I like this app. Creates some very beautiful pictures. Would love to see an option to preview the effect before taking the pic.
3	B004K594X0	Perfect replacement for the standard android camera. Has tons of features to choose from. Recommend you try free version for compatibility purposes before purchasing.
3	B004K594X0	simply best and great. It should be native camera app. many effects, good camera functions. ok enough number of choices for frames. can't find any missing functions other have but vignette.
3	B004K594X0	Best camera App to date. I own several, including camera zoom and spyphone. They each serve their purpose, but vignette has some serious power. Perfect balance between effects, and actually being able to take a decent photo and take advantage of your phones camera. Ton of features, and love the set up for ISO sensitivity as well as being easy to configure on the fly. The random effect setting is an awesome touch. Buy it.
1	B004K594X0	this is neat app to own. definate fun and lot of effects to play around after you shoot a picture,or either pull up a picture from your gallery. after editing, with a breeze of a click, upload to your facebook,etc. loved this app!
3	B004K594X0	I downloaded this for when it was the amazon app of the day, and it has since completely replaced my stock phone camera app. The response time is faster, and the all-around quality of the photos is much better than other apps, especially the stock software.The best part of Vignette is the multitude of camera effects that give character to the photos without having to worry with using Photoshop. The effects also process themselves much faster than the waiting time in the "Retro Camera" app. This app is well worth the price.
3	B004K594X0	I bought this program over on the play store when it first came out and have been a strong advocate and supporter and even a  bug tester for it ever since. The developers work very hard on this application and it is written to be as up to snuff as possible and it is rock solid and powerful powerful powerful. this is the go-to photography app on Android don't let anyone ever tell you different. 5 stars is not enough for this application it is truly a gem and an amazing feat of programming. It is so cutting edge that I don't even have the words to explain it. You just have to invest in it and use it and know that it is worth every penny.
1	B004K59O4E	I thought it sounded fun but isn't. First, when you get done with it an ad comes up for dating and when you get rid of it there is a picture of your cake and it is very small.  clearly this ap is meant for phones and not kindle fires because it also says &quot;there is a problem with your microphone&quot; .  I thought it would come up with a large virtual cake complete with several burning candles but it's a very tiny picture with one candle burning and a &quot;number&quot; for how many candles you chose.  it isn't a game or a fun thing exactly, its only to make an e-card sort of thing. I probably wont keep it. Other than the pop up ad you have to dismiss, and the microphone question box, it does have a lot of ways to do a cake so it might be good for somebody.
3	B004K59O4E	This a nice little app.  Very basic decorations, but can be mixed up a bit.  My daughter loved receiving het &quot;b-day cake&quot;.  I really hope they add more!
3	B004K59O4E	As stated above, this app is awesome! I love how you can make a cake and e-mail it!!!! Totally recommending it!!!! If you have a problem with my review, feel happy to comment!
1	B004K59O4E	not worth the option to let my kids play, too much risk of downloading junk ads and other problems.. .

3	B004K59O4E	Makes me hungry thoYou can make a cake, decorate it, and attach a song. When you are done, you can share it on Facebook or email it. Not bad for a free app.The little animal designs are very cute.
2	B004K59O4E	I mean its ok, but it could be better. what if u could make ur own recipe,  tht would be awesome!
1	B004K59O4E	This app is so dumb I can't believe I was so stupid to get the stupid thing me and my brother both fell asleep playing it.
3	B004K59O4E	This app is a lot of fun. You get to make your own birthday cake how cool is that. So cool.
1	B004K59O4E	i cant blow the candle out this is soo stupidi wish i didnt download this why would the even make this
2	B004K59O4E	WOW, THIS APP IS GREAT AND I JUST GOT IT I CAN,T WAIT TO TEST IT OUT '!!!!!!!  WISH ME GOOD LUCK
1	B004K59O4E	this is the worst game I have ever played don't buy it if you have a kindle you cant even blow the candles
3	B004K59O4E	its such a good game ........buy it!!!!!! its so fun to make these cakes!!!!!I reccomened it for you!!!!BUY!!!  if I were you I would buy it:)
3	B004K59O4E	This app is really fun! But I think it could be better. It doesn't show u what ur cake looks like until the end. Plus, Kindle fires don't have microphones!!!!!! I wish it could be more like cakemaker which is an apple app.
1	B004K59O4E	ok this app is so boring all you do is pick a cake and decorate it. On kindle fire u cant even blow out the candle!!!
1	B004K5HY5A	k sooo I haven't played this app but it looks stupid. WHYYYY is it so hard 2 find good apps. also wish that every app was free. EVERY app. thanks
1	B004K5HY5A	This game is very simple, fun, and addicting.However I rated this app only one star because it is outright plagiarism of Brad Bourne's Fancy Pants on [...].  It is not a similarity; some of the animations and "Miss Jump" herself are exact copies of Fancy Pants.  Very irritating.
1	B004K5HY5A	I don't have it, but this is COPIED from fancy pants! Do not get this &quot;app&quot;! You would be supporting plagiarism!
1	B004K5HY5A	One star because it looks exactly like fancy pants.  If i created an awesome character like fancy pants and someone just takes it and gives them a different name..even if it is fun it's still a copy.
1	B004K5HY5A	the game boss COPIED fancy pants wow what's a sucky loser this game needs to be banned not cool delete ifyou have rate 1 star or ZERO STARS!
3	B004K5K92K	Isn't sad that this is my most used app... it's enough to make you cry...*sob*. Seriously, if you have some apps ( has to be from an android thing, though) you want to trash, then this app is for you.
1	B004K5K92K	GARBAGE deleted after 1 try  not what I expected the item to be. It was deleted after first use junk sorry but junk
3	B004K5K92K	Fast way to get rid of unwanted Amazon store apps.  Very simple to use.  Crank it up, then click on the undesired app. This may take a few moments to scroll through the big list. Once you select some apps to uninstall, There is a window at the bottom that says, &#34;Uninstall apps.&#34;  It shows how many will be uninstalled.  You still have to acknowledge with &#34;Ok&#34; for each one, which is just a minor annoyance.&#8730; Recommended!
1	B004K5K92K	I wanted to remove apps from my Kindle. All it. did was move the apps to the cloud which you can do with a long press.
2	B004K5K92K	this runs in the background, consumes resources but doesn't actually to anything.  it also doesn't show accurate dates for last use.
1	B004K5K92K	No better than the system control on the phone. Only one star because it said it would remove any app but it won't touch the crap apps Sprint and HTC force onto the phone.
3	B004K5K92K	I got my granddaughter to help me find this site.  I have been disappointed with a few sites.  I am guessing this 3 apps I had deleted with the App Cleaner.
2	B004K5K92K	Haven't found this especially useful.  Doesn't hurt to have it, but not much help to me.  But see what you think.
3	B004K5K92K	I have used this when my home page is too cluttered to find anything.  It is the quickest and easiest way to houseclean old apps.
1	B004K5K92K	Did not do what I wanted or expected.  It will remove apps that I downloaded but I can easily do that without an app.  I am now think that if Google put it there it can not be deleted.
3	B004K5K92K	This is a good app. I downloaded it and used it.It's a good product to use. Just like a lap top or anycomputer they need to be cleaned.
2	B004K5K92K	I wonder what chuck Norris would say if he were to check out this app. maybe the Dec would get a stern round house kick to the belly button.
2	B004K5K92K	does what is indicates, easy install, tap on the app, 3 options,uninstalllaunchdetails, cannot open details, tried it on several apps.tapping on the 3 lines in the box, bottom centerclear all data, used when changing owners,,..settings app cleaner notification, hide: standard android, google, htc appssearch optionrefresh, manual operation, sometimes it works, updating the informationwould give more stars, missing logout, and option to auto refresh,the number of apps indicates matches with lookout mobile security for kindle fire hd.
1	B004K5K92K	I don't like anything about the Kindle fire I don't like not having access to the FREE google store for apps. I prefer the Ipad over the kindle fire any day.
1	B004K5K92K	There are other apps that install better with more options and much faster than this. It's also rediculous that amazon doesn't think someone can get their point across in fewer than 25 words.
2	B004K5K92K	I'm still on the fence with this it uninstalled my apps now I'm just waiting to see if the performance gets better wish me luck people!
3	B004K5K92K	With help from the Kindle staff I got it downloaded and it does what it says it does - gets rid of apps you no longer want.
1	B004K5K92K	I cannot figure out it use, or for that matter, its use...period.  What is it suppose to do anyway?  Grrr!
3	B004K5K92K	It does what it says it is supposed to do and does it with one click, without accessing drop-down menus and looking for the app to delete.
1	B004K5K92K	App Cleaner is an app you can skip. When you choose an app after a scan and clip &#34;yes&#34; to remove it, App Cleaner gives you a message saying that it is unable to delete the app.  Worthless waste of time. Use Kindle Cleaner instead.....it will remove any app you ask it to.
3	B004K5K92K	I needed something to get rid of unused apps and tried this one. It works great and is a good tool.
3	B004K5K92K	Easy to install and easy to use.Seems to remove alll traces of progams.Easy to learn . Very fast in removing unwanted programs.
2	B004K5K92K	Good product, this has kept my device free and clear of any problems. It does not drain the battery like some others.
3	B004K5K92K	it is amazing! it saves SO much time! it is easy and deletes all the apps you don't want!this sentence is just so that I can feel up space and post my review for you to read.
3	B004K5K92K	Makes erasing unwanted apps very easy just like it says. I had no problems at all, if you want an app remover then this is for you.
3	B004K5K92K	I got this App Cleaner to clean my Apps up and after using this App Cleaner, it became very aparent that it was in fact, cleaning my Apps.
3	B004K5K92K	the app is easy to use and works well. it's important to properly maintain computer related devices and deleting items like apps doesn't always completely get rid of all the components associated with the app. this can cause the device to slowdown or malfunction.
3	B004K5K92K	This app works great. Lists all apps then you check a box to select it.Then at bottom of screen UNINSTALL select button and it uninstall'sone at a time, we your approval.works great
1	B004K5K92K	I like it and it done a good job but the apps are still there so it was a waste of time
2	B004K5K92K	Use the one with the broom more. Not sure its still installed anymore. Probably just preference. I just don't use it.
3	B004K5K92K	Keeping a clean computer is a must and this app helps to keep it smooth.  Once installed it is easy to use and a must have.
3	B004K5K92K	Daughters kindle kept getting locked up (8gb) with only one movie, 50 songs and maybe 20 apps. When everything was first installed she had a good 3.5 gb left and over a couple months she complained she couldn't do things. I checked the memory and it had less than .5 gb. WTH. SO I researched and the cache gets cluttered really easy. this takes care of the problem. I showed her how to use and told her about once a month we need to just clean her kindle.
3	B004K5K92K	Shuts down non-essential functions so your device can operate better and faster. Definitely worth getting, especially since it's A FREEBIE!
1	B004K5K92K	its great for cleaning apps because when itried to clean my apps with another app cleaner it did not work nut this one does huh I like it even my wife loves it
3	B004K5K92K	This app works ok but I have found that it is not as helpful as I thought it would be.  I had to change the settings several times before I got it the way I wanted it.
3	B004K5K92K	This app is awesome. It detects unused apps which gives me more space for apps I like. I strongly recommend it.
1	B004K5K92K	Application loads and then crashes immediately and it doesn't report the information to the developer like the other applications due. Therefore the developer has no way of knowing how to fix the application in the future. Basically this is a fatal flaw in the development cycle of the application . As such this program will never improve. As such the program has no hope . I have 800 apps and it's loaded on Samsung galaxy S4 with a 16 GB SD card almost every other program of the 800 work fine.
1	B004K5K92K	I have NFL mobile, and I am not a sports fan, and I can't get rid if this app. There are other apps that came pre-installed and I can't get rid of them, either.
2	B004K5K92K	I found it makes cleaning applications easier. I usually uninstall apps one at a time when I find useful, but this gives a view to all applications installed on the device which aren't usually visible.
1	B004K5K92K	Not sure why this is in the Amazon ap store as you do not need it on the kindles readers or kindle fire.
3	B004K5K92K	To the people who are unhappy because this app cannot uninstall the unwanted apps that the manufacturer included with your phone or tablet: There is NO uninstaller that can remove these built-in applications. Manufacturers and the OS developer make certain of it. Some reviewers try to explain this. If you don't read those reviews, you won't understand. BUT ... good news! You *can* remove unwanted apps. Here's how: &quot;Root&quot; your device (look it up). This will give you more power over your phone/tablet. It will also 1) terminate your warranty and 2) leave your device more vulnerable to malware (look it up), etc. But, hey, you'll have what you want - at least until you run into trouble and need to find another developer to blame for the fact that your device is now a brick. Good luck there, Bubba!
3	B004K5K92K	It help me to keep my tablet clear and free of unused apps which I is most needed plus its free..
3	B004K5K92K	found more apps than I knew there was on my tablet. it has many tools and is fast opperating on my system
1	B004K5K92K	I was trying to get a cleaner app that would tell me whether the program is necessary to the phone.  All this does is tell that I haven't used it.  It's really no less work than cleaning out the apps through the phone Settings.
3	B004K5K92K	I love this app b/c it actually lets u see the size of all the apps that u have downloaded on your device so that u can delete the apps that take up the most space. By using this app,  I have been able to delete some apps and clear a lot of space on my device. this app also shows u which apps u never use and makes it easier to delete those apps. the only problem is that I wish they had an app that can do this for all your internal storage instead of just the apps.
3	B004K5K92K	Very good app to get for your tablet. I couldn't believe how many apps can be put on your tablet and don't even put them on yourself. So it good to check and clear out some of them every now and then. Works Great!!
1	B004K5K92K	This did not work for my phone -- still have things I am trying to get rid of.  Too bad - nice idea
1	B004K5K92K	This identifies apps to remove on my FIRE, but does not remove the icon/picture. Maybe they have an updated version, in which case, what will I use to remove this one???
3	B004K5K92K	this little android app cleaner keeps my kindle fire running so well! it constantly monitors my kindle fire and along with another app, which i will review makes me a very happy kindle owner.
3	B004K5K92K	I got this app for my kindle fire and it works great, I hope they make more useful apps like this one.
3	B004K5K92K	Simple, direct, and to the point, without a lot of confusion for those of us who don't know the ends and outs of every program.  It helped clean my kindle of some unwanted files, made my kindle run faster by clearing the memory, and doesn't include a bunch of adds and whatnot.  Altogether, I am happy.
3	B004K5K92K	Good to have if you download an install a lot of apps/games on your phone.  It will get rid of all the leftover files.
3	B004K5K92K	it totally works on my kindle fire!!!!because I sometimes only apps because of their pictureand tittle but then I see it sucks!! so this app is awesome to use to get rid of this apps!!!!! their like flies running around you!!!!( and I mean the apps that suck)
2	B004K5K92K	Basic uninstaller. For all the noobs and idiots out there complaining about bloat ware google &quot;root&quot;...your cell provider had locked down your phone and forcing you to accept whatever software they want to. All providers do it, its wrong, it sucks but that's big business for them. There is not a single app out there that can remove bloatware by itself. You have to root.
2	B004K5K92K	I dont have any problems with app cleaner. It does what its supposto. I have notiesd that all it does is clean app but it is very heipful if you dont want the app and its takeing up memery. So if yoyr the kind of person that wants to have more memmery then get this app. NOW!!!!!
3	B004K9ENC8	I like the game. It has great pictures, and challenging differences to find. it is a game for both kids and adult.
3	B004K9ENC8	very good memory game and great for your mind and eyes without the flashing. I can't do the games that flash so these are great and they don't make me feel stupid cause I don't know the answers.
3	B004K9ENC8	This is mindless fun...and not all of the items are easy to spot.I think this game is one that even younger (probably preteen on up)kids would enjoy when stuck someplace and bored...just hand them theKindle Fire or other Android product and let them have some fun. Itwill keep them busy while you are at your Dr. appointment or whatever.They use real photograph's not drawings or cartoons for their pictures.
3	B004K9ENC8	Reminds me a little of the Where's Waldo? series of books (haha), but for grown-ups! A little frustrating when your time runs out and you have one thing left to find, but some pictures are a great challenge and "wake up" your brain! We can all use a little brain exercise. GREAT App! Droid 3
1	B004K9ENC8	this was so easy my 3 year old could do  it by her self so we removed it to free up space
3	B004K9ENC8	This is my genre. I love Find Differences. I wish that these were larger because I have problems spotting the differences. However, I have been using my magnifying glass to enlarge the pics and doing really good.
3	B004K9ENC8	If you love find the difference games, you will want this game. It has many scenes and they are not too easy. You really have to look everywhere. Clues are available if you get stuck. Have fun!
3	B004K9ENC8	My fiance and I love these type of games. We enjoy playing them. I would def recommend this to others!
3	B004K9ENC8	Mind blowing and the unlimited amount of pictures makes the game last for days, weeks, months.  It's definitely a brain banger, it will change the way you see things especially in comparisons.  Pretty cool
3	B004K9ENC8	Sometimes I think I'm just blind because I can't see any difference!  But when it shows them to me.. duh.. it was right there and I looked right past it.  Love these games.
3	B004K9ENC8	A fun game to play. Really has you looking for differences and trains you to look for the differences in things,.
3	B004K9ENC8	I like that the photos are of tons of different things not just about one thing.  I wish there were no timer so you could free play instead of it chastising you and showing you the last picture difference whether you ask for it or not.
3	B004K9ENC8	really fun game keeps you entertianed with new levels all the time a definite yes I think this is one of the best apps on the market
3	B004K9ENC8	I have always loved doing those types of games in magazines and whatnots, but when I saw this app, I had to have it.  I am so glad I did.  I totally love it.  It definitely gives me what I'm looking for...a challenge. It's not your little kids game.  :)
3	B004K9ENC8	I continue to enjoy playing this game and it provided you with options to earn more hints as  you progress through the game.  The imagery is good and interesting, the only downfall - I wish there were more images to continue playing.  Definately one of the better "find the differences" apps.
1	B004K9ENC8	Hard to believe it is so highly rated when it is so poorly configured. THIN CIRCLES are a joke...after you work so hard you are not sure the find is noted with the TOO TOO thin circles. And how can a person rank it high when they also point out the real flaw: too few pics...and the ones here are hard to discern with their dark shades and grainey (lack of) colour in the pics......
1	B004KA0RBS	really bad development. not worth .99 or being free. wish I could remove from my acct so I don't have to know I have it
1	B004KA0RBS	I download nearly every Amazon FAOTD and try them, hoping I find some good apps. I have and will continue. I rarely review them. this one, though, is awful. It's a poorly designed knockoff of vastly superior games to make money. This game is not fun and it's only challenging because none of the notes match the beat properly. I appreciate the effort developers put into these games and LOVE the FAOTD, but this game was designed purely to scam people out of a dollar.
1	B004KA0RBS	Don't waste your money! This app is rediculous! Even if u do get it free, uninstall imediatly! What will they come up with next?
1	B004KA0RBS	Not worth a buck. Actually it's just a waste of time. you can't really upload songs. once you upload, it asks you how many beats per minute it has (as if I know that) &amp; offers a handy calculator that you tap and it's supposed to calculate the bpm for you. the counter just stays at zero. also, you have to know the song you're uploading very well because it doesn't actually play it for you so you can tap the &quot;calculator&quot;. BUT you can manually add in the beats per minute (again, good luck guessing), however then, when you try to play it, it doesn't play and gives you an A. This game sucks. and I wasted even more time writing this review. FAIL.
1	B004KA0RBS	whether you play the easy level or other levels, the beat ends up slipping and when the brat of the song says to tap, the arrows will usually be a quarter beat behind. bummer. I really wanted to like this one.
3	B004KA0RBS	i dont know what the fuss is all about. the beat is right on. the compase on the bottom is just a finger pad and nothing more. wait till the arrows reach the top and alighn with the other arrows. and uploading your own music is cool. complain on what the bpm is for your song. no prob i am sure there is an app for that i am going to look for one right now.
1	B004KA0RBS	do not buy the controls don't work!! it is horrible it is not worth you money the tempo is horrible and the game design is even worse
1	B004KA0RBS	I think the other 58 1 star reviews say enough, but I am going to make it 59 (and counting I'm sure) to warn people that this app is horrid.I downloaded and played this a couple of times this morning before I went to bed (overnight worker) and thought I must be tired and doing something wrong. I woke up and saw all the reviews and realized I wasn't doing anything wrong, this game is just bad.I like DDR games and was actually looking at buying this app about a month ago but glad I waited because 1) I got it as the FAOTD, and 2) It's so bad that I would be demanding my $1 back from Amazon or never touching their app store again.I normally don't review Amazon here because I understand this is where you review the app, but they really should be ashamed of themselves for even having this on their market, and whipped for putting it up as the FAOTD.
1	B004KA0RBS	I love DDR. I'm also a fan of Tap Tap Revolution.  this is a hhorrible clone of a shadow of a rhythm game.  timing is horrendous, graphics don't fit on qHD screen. its a joke. glad I didn't pay anything.
1	B004KA0RBS	This app is terrible. Makes me sad that someone both wasted thier time on this and I had to waste even a byte of my data on this worthlessness. This shouldn't cost any money alone. Personally, I would prefer either Tap Tap Revenge 4, or hitting myself in the head with a brick instead of playing this. Tl;dnr? Sucks. Uninstalled.
3	B004KA0RBS	I loved this game because we have.one at home big version and we love thatthis game is the best
1	B004KA0RBS	random pushing the buttons during a song gets better score than following the game...., does not run well on X2X28
1	B004KA0RBS	Its pretty simple to make a rhythm game, all you have to do is make sure the game matches the rhythm, which is exactly where this app failed. The arrows on the field slowly get out of sync then accelerate rapidly to catch back up, making.it impossible to hit the arrows in time with the music. your better off musing the audio and trying.to just hit the arrows on your own.
1	B004KA0RBS	Ive downloaded it before and it was bad, I guess the amazon version is no different, I give it one star because they wont let me put no stars.
3	B004KA0RBS	I love this. the music is j pop but catchy it is a learning curve trying to play it the first time but it is fuuun wish it had some backgrounds but still I love this game
1	B004KA0RBS	Rubbish. The touch controls are off, the music sounds Horrible. The graphics are so low quality. I never give bad reviews but this is so bad it should be pulled from the appstore. Waste of time and money.
3	B004KA0RBS	I almost didn't download this as the FAotD due to the extremely bad reviews. I decided to since all I have to lose is the minute it would take to download it. I figured if it really is that bad I can keep it around for a bit to see if the developer updates it. So I tried the game. Played two songs, one on easy the other on medium. I think there's a HUUUUUUUGE misunderstanding here. You're suppose to hit the buttons when the corresponding color hits the arrow at the TOP. DON'T hit the arrows when they pop up on the bottom! It took me all of 20 seconds to figure that out. Come on people, it isn't rocket science.I think people are just jumping on the band wagon of bad reviews without even trying to figure out how to play the gameThe button layout looks fine on my transformer. It stretches of course since this isn't optimized for a tablet, but still, everything fits just fine. 5 stars for being good and free. If it weren't free I'd give it 4.
3	B004KA0RBS	alrite... first thingsz first. i would have never payed for this app. now its not terrible but its definately not top quality.in all of the songs, not just user uploaded, the notes all seem to be random. makes it weird to play.if your into ddr i believe you will dig this app. or if you like rythm games i think youll dig this app (especially with it being free app of the day).the songs arent very good... its definately nice to be able to load your own songs (even the you have to know the bpm). just dont expect anything great.thats the bottom line really... just dont expect something great. nice start to a ddr clone, now just keep adding new features and enhancing the curret ones.
1	B004KA0RBS	so this game freezes while you are playing it causing you to miss a lot of points. the music is lame and the directional pad is in the way of the upcoming moves. next&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
2	B004KA0RBS	The game is a little easy because of how it is controlled, but for those that need some DDR on the go, it is a great option. The price isn't bad either. The lack of difficulty does make it boring fairly fast though.
1	B004KA0RBS	this game stinks! how on earth are you people able to get more than an F? impossible and like I said LAME!!!!( o
1	B004KA0RBS	it is a copy of dance dance revolution. but with fingers. how cheesy. i say don't waste your money on this app! agree with the other reviews.
3	B004KA0RBS	jebhshsvssbsbsbzj ueueysgs ueeueueyehs bdhdjd dj sk Jean jays Jens ieue eyeydh rush shhshs wjjsj owns jays Eben sh hwh hahah
1	B004KA0RBS	I played this for about fifteen minutes but could not take it anymore. My hand and my wrist hurt. There wasn't much of a song selection and I think the developers missed the entire point of dance-dance revolution with this. A lot of people enjoy it because you can have it on your sound system and get a little bit of a workout while playing a game. No workout on this app, just cramped fingers. Ugh, what was I thinking even giving it a shot?No redemptive value in this game. Don't bother picking it up.
1	B004KA0RBS	what makes this game terrible is the fact that it doesn't really follow the rhythm of the songs. if you've played other rhythm games, you know the fun part about them is that you need to react to the song, but you're better off playing this game on mute if you want to do well
1	B004KA0RBS	terrible response in the controls,  terrible music list,  I wouldn't pay for this app just awful , terrible game. don't buy
1	B004KA0RBS	not worth a dollar but good other than thatif it was free it would be great. just so simple. guess im to picky, been playing ddr for years
3	B004KA0RBS	I don't understand all those who gave it 1 star. The game is fun works great on my phone. I always played ddr an it brings back old memories. A fun game to play during my off time.
1	B004KA0RBS	You know those products that are a cheap knockoff and aren't worth a nickel, but the makers (developers) push it anyway? The bosses say to their subordinates, &quot;Oh, who cares if it sucks, just put [recognizable item] on it, the idiot public won't know the difference!&quot; That's exactly what has happened with this app. They took the DDR idea and just made a crappy game where arrows fly up and you hit buttons, but the gameplay (what made DDR so successful) is as shallow as a puddle in mid-summer.The core aspect of a rhythm game is just that -- rhythm. Shame on the developer who thought people would take interest in (and pay money for!!) this flimsy, crappy sham of a music game.In short, to anyone considering this application: run. Run away and never return!
1	B004KA0RBS	If I had paid for this I would have been pissed. Prompts don't line up with the beats, UI is pretty bad, and the song selection isn't too hot. It's pretty obvious somebody didn't test this well... or at all.
1	B004KA0RBS	This game only guesses at the beat when using songs. It doesn't analyze the actual song and instead relies on beats per minute for calculating where to put the steps.
1	B004KA0RBS	this is THE WORST app on the market. COMPLETE waste of money don't even think about buying it. there's a good 6 songs to choose from and even the easy is hard.
2	B004KA0RBS	The layout isn't very good and its nit all that fun. The graphics look kind of weird and stretched out on 7in Honeycomb tablet. Its worth the free download but I certainly wouldn't pay anything for it.
1	B004KA0RBS	I wouldn't normally waste my time writing a bad review, but someone may spend their hard-earned money on this, otherwise.This app is awful.  Not only pointlessly mind- numbing, but annoying to boot!  Even the music is bad; poorly performed and chosen.Save your time and money.
3	B004KA0RBS	to people who do like this app, i know its great. The song making isnt what i expected, but nothing is ever perfect in life.To the people who dont like this app: if you dont like it because it is too hard, then you just stink at this. (AKA user error. go big or go home.)The one doen side is cost. not everything can be free, and thats implied. but 2 dollars?? Give me a break.
3	B004KA0RBS	it works perfectly on my Droid Pro. if it doesn't work on your phone you might want to consider a new phone. it isn't the app's fault.
1	B004KA0RBS	send music has no bearing on the game itself. the beat does not match with when you type the items. not really worth your time. I should have seen the 100 negative reviews and not played myself.
2	B004KA0RBS	The easier levels never are in real time that a person can really pick a drum beat.  But the higher levels are good with being to the beat.  The problem is that the program uses so much resources that it lags here and there.  Even with my 1ghz processor.
3	B004KA0RBS	im actually really excited this is free app of the day. even if it isnt perfect i LOVE ddr and this is a good attempt at a clone.hoping there are updates and improvements to this game!
3	B004KA0RBS	I wonder sometimes if it is too easy to download apps from amazon. You should only be able to download if you first prove you have the ability to read the app instructions.
3	B004KA0RBS	Kind of a fun game... I could get addicted to this... Good for hand eye coordination... Is there an online battle capability? That would be totally wicked....
1	B004KA0RBS	Maybe I am asking too much... But I feel that a game based on rhythmically hitting buttons to a song should have those buttons actually in the rhythm...  No?  Horrible joke of an app.
1	B004KA0RBS	First, whoever sang &quot; We Are The Champions&quot; needs to be forced to never sing again; that performance was in and of itself a cardinal sin.Second, a dance game has RHYTHM. Oh my gosh, what a shocker. It's not even worth free. The developer owes me money for wasting my time.
3	B004KA0RBS	This game is flawed in many ways for use by an older child or adult.  Just read some other reviews to see why.  This should be marketed as a young child's game.  It keeps my 6 and 4 year old entertained and is relatively simple for them to use.  For a child's game, I give it four stars.  For anyone else, don't bother.
1	B004KA0RBS	i tried this because it was the free app of the day. I'm glad i didn't pay for it, the timings are screwed all to hell, song selection sucks, and it makes my ocd go insane.
2	B004KA0RBS	My son plays the d d r all the time And thought this was great! You need to read the instructions first, then you will understand the game.I could barely get the phone from my son to rate this application! He is doing great and already has gone up at least 1 level.People are relying too much on what others are saying about this game without tryin it themselves.Yes the songs are crappy and harsh but I had my son go into the other room with it and he just loves it! If a 4 year old kid can do it, you should try and learn it for yourselfBut be careful, you may like it!And no I am not a developer. I don't know the first thing how to program 1 of these phones. I usually have my son show me what I need to do!
1	B004KA0RBS	I am bored with fun and well thought out games, so this dull, poorly designed, and buggy game was just what I was looking for.
1	B004KA0RBS	I hate to join the chorus, but don't waste your time on this one. Even free, it's not worth it: cheesy music, poor controls, horrible graphics, incomprehensible synchronization, etc..WHALE  FAIL!is there such a thing as 0 stars? This is a definite contender!
3	B004KA0RBS	This game worked great on my fire.  For free you can only upload 1 additional song but it is still fun.  Setting bomb was easy given the in-game help.  $2 to upload more songs seems worth it...definitely better than guitar hero.  Once you get into a comfortable holding position, this is great for the fire.  Try it for free, if you don't like it then delete.
1	B004KA0RBS	I'm really shocked this sucks as bad as is does. It's not the music selection but the implementation of the app itself.The main point of the game, hit the correct arrows to the beat of the music is seriously flawed. As in there doesn't seem to be any discernible beat or pattern to the arrows,  Without a rhythm or pattern this is impossible, especially on harder levels.If you like listening to music while tapping randomly on the screen you may like this, of your looking for even a ballpark rendition of Dance Revolution look elsewhere, this ain't it.Poorly written apps like this give Android such a bad name, how could someone think of charging the same as Angry Birds for this?I know its free today, but its not even worth that in this state.
1	B004KA0RBS	This game would be fun, but its stupid! It doesn't have a beat! I've never played a worst game than that! Don't buy, its a waste of money,
3	B004KA0RBS	1* for being free. 1* for dev effort. 2*'s for user reviews. Hey, this app needs all the boost it can get.
3	B004KA0RBS	How could you hate thiz app? for 2 dollars it is worth the inaccuracy of the notes because you get to use your songs!
3	B004KA0RBS	The developers of this should have to sit in time out for the next five years. This is just wrong. Finger dancing? Not on my phone.
2	B004KA0RBS	My main problem with this is that the finger keys are not defined enough. I found myself missing the buttons by a fraction because I couldn't destinguish the actual button from the background. As well I take off a second star because the songs are only about half the length of the original. That's what happens when you bypass copy write laws I guess.
1	B004KA0RBS	This app is junk.  Just like every other guitar hero/ddr app available.  Songs sound like garbage, touch interface is a millisecond off so the touch feels odd.  On top of it all the only other review on here is clearly a plant by the company that makes the app, or someone closely related to the production.  &quot;it's fun and easy to use&quot; ...ya right.  More like &quot;it sucks and I'm a tool!&quot;
1	B004KA0RBS	How oh how can a game this bad even be picked to be the free app of the day? Does Amazon even pay attention to the apps that they pick to feature? I have seen some bad games in my time but this one takes the cake! It is absolutely horrible in every way. Not even worth free.
1	B004KA0RBS	I am pretty sure the developers had to TRY to fail so hard this time. this game absolutely blows. Nothing about it works properly.  I would rather finger my eye socket than wish this game on someone.
1	B004KA0RBS	Luckily this was the free app of the day. It was interesting for one song. I'll probably delete it and never play again. Music and moves don't sync. The UP arrow sort of forces you to block part of the screen. Kept losing my place when switching from UP to any other arrow. Maybe I just suck, but I can't help but think that the controls could have been layed out just a little bit better. Didn't have enough interest to even try uploading my own music, but judging by the other reviews, it doesn't look like it delivers on the idea it implies.Buy at your own risk.
1	B004KA0RBS	The song selection on this application is terrible. Oh, and if you want to upload your own song, you have to know exactly how many beats per minute the song is. I knew that exact info for three of my own tracks, but the finger notes still didn't even come close to matching the tempo of my songs. Not even worth having on my phone at free, so I uninstalled.
1	B004KA0RBS	Very amateur looking game. And it plays like one, too. Gets very boring after the first song. The available songs are horrid and ear piercing. The custom song option doesn't work at all. I tried it numerous times with no avail.For free it's worth a try. But this feels like a free, ad based game in the first place. Try it out. You may like it, but I doubt it.
3	B004KA1YE2	This is the easiest and most convenient way to  get files on and off of my tablet.  It only took about five minutes to learn it.  Works best for small files.  USB is faster for large files (100 MB or more) but, this is still more convenient if you have the pro.
1	B004KA1YE2	Some simple instructions would be helpfull. I've no idea how to use it. Boo Hiss! Not as &quot;easy&quot; as advertised.
3	B004KA1YE2	Works as described, a good way to make sure you understand how to use the pro version before buying it- which I rated 5 stars. But even just to download/view files this is still very very good and free.
3	B004KA1YE2	No matter what I did, even chatting with LG customer support and following all her directions, I could not get my photos to transfer from my LG TracFone Android phone to my Windows 8.1 computer. (LG spent over an hour chatting with me then told me to call TracFone, who hasn't replied to my Trouble Request yet).Finally, I got the idea to see if I could transfer the files to my KINDLE instead, and found this in Amazon's Kindle Store.This solved my problem. It allows me to transfer files FROM my phone or FROM my Kindle to my computer, and if I open a browser on the phone or the Kindle, it should allow me, for free, to download files form phone to Kindle, or vice versa.HOW IT WORKS: When you open this program on your Android device (phone or Kindle in my case), it assigns an IP address to itself. On any other device on your WiFi network, open your browser and type that IP address, for example, http://192.128.0.5:8000Once your browser is on that page, you can navigate to any directory, then download one or more files from the device that WiFi File Explorer is running on.If I upgrade to the PRO edition, or if the author gives me a PRO upgrade in order to get my honest review, then I'm betting that I will get many more features, including uploading files from my computer to those devices by WiFi.I'd give this TEN STARS if I could.@HungryByteman
3	B004KA1YE2	Sometimes I think people who give good ratings for lousy apps mist work for the developer, but in this case for sure, the comments I read were spot on about how well this app works. There was no confusion, no password loops and registration problems. I'm happy with it.
1	B004KA1YE2	I am sure that my own lack of training along with the limits of this program makes ituseless for me.
3	B004KA1YE2	Very easy to use faster then getting out the USB cablerun program type IP address in Internet explorer address window, bookmark pagefor next time, and transfer your movies,photos,files to your kindle fire.it's that easy.....and it's fast too.
3	B004KA1YE2	This will be the first thing I will pay to upgrade to the unfree version.  It works fantastic, only you can transfer files to you computer for free, but if you want transfer from computer to kindle, it'll cost you ;)
3	B004KA1YE2	GREAT PRODUCT AT A SUPER PRICE.  EASY TO USE AND SET UP AND NO CABLES TO PLUG IN AND SETUP.  VERY GOOD PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.
3	B004KA1YE2	App allows transfer of files from phone to tablet now I have pix on my tablet that are on my phone. Yaay
1	B004KA1YE2	I was looking for an app to transfer PC photos and videos to my Kindle Fire, but this does not do that.
2	B004KA1YE2	This game is okay. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have protected internet or what's to know more about there WiFi service. But I would recommend for eveyone
2	B004KA1YE2	I downloaded this app to use but did not use.  Therefore, I really cannot rate the app positively or negatively.
1	B004KA1YE2	DO NOT REMEMBER GETTING THIS!! i HAVE A LITTLE DOT FOR MY WIFI, DON'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND (EXPLORE) HOW TO USE A WIFI. BETTER TUTORIALS AND IN LAYMENS TERMINOLOGY. THANKS Kim Moore
2	B004KA1YE2	Why get this one unless you understand wifi. Lots of other choices will be better to choose from. Just my opinion
3	B004KA1YE2	this is a must for those that wish to connect to their kindle fire to side load apps, personal music and file from their pc or mac without using a usb cable. it very easy and user friendly to use. Just make sure you get the paid version the free one isn't worth the download. all the free version does is allow you to browse whats on the kindle fire from or pc or mac and that is it. beside you you wont regret getting the paid version after the first time you use it. on a side note if you get this also pick up file explorer es it a free app i believe it makes navigating and find things in you file system on the kindle easier.
2	B004KA1YE2	This app is okay at doing what it claims, but I prefer to use ES File Explorer.I use ES on my tablet and phone.
3	B004KA1YE2	This works as advertised on my TF101. I would give it another star if the page that it serves up had a couple of hints for the functions,  I did finally figure them out.
3	B004KA1YE2	It works like advertised. It is limited in what it does but if you only want to transfer files then this is a great app.I gave it only 4 stars as I needed more capabilities.
3	B004KA1YE2	it works with my kindle just great, I'm able to maneuver without a problem, great to have a simple transition from one's PC/laptop
2	B004KA1YE2	It will check your files on your Kindle Fire HD, but if you have a cord for your computer, that will work the same way. And, you can't access your files like you can with the cord, so it really makes it worthless. Your computer has to be on for this app to work, as it needs to connect to it.
3	B004KA1YE2	Without a doubt this worked just fine but not quite as well as the Pro Version which I now own.
3	B004KA1YE2	I have used this to make extra space on my phone by deleting older app downloads, but after a while, my phone started doing that on its own (without using this app).It was a disappointment when we found that it could not help my wife to upload photos into her phone for use by another app, but perhaps that function is one that requires an upgrade.
1	B004KA1YE2	It will allow other devices to explore the Kindle but wont allow the kindle to explore other devices unless the too are a kindle/Android running this same tool.
3	B004KA1YE2	This and the camera in my cell group phone is all a grandpa could ask for. Saves all the trouble of plugging the phone into the computer to transfer pics to the slideshow software.
1	B004KA1YE2	It did not work very well on my HTC Thunderbolt. It was very slow to transfer info even on my &#34;N&#34; network.
3	B004KA1YE2	I was having some network problems and when that happens I like to go back to square one and verify each step. I was trying wi-fi and I wanted to make sure I had wi-fi correct, so I used this app.It turned out that wi-fi was not it for streaming so I ended up with an Ethernet wire. Thus, I no longer use this app.If you have and use wi-fi, this can be the ticket for you.
3	B004KA1YE2	A great file explorer if you have WiFi. Very useful if you don't want to pull out the memory card or you cant if your using A KFIRE. I recommend getting the paid version because its more feature filled. Also, you can backup your kindle or device by DL the entire thing and also backup important data that may be saved. I highly recommend this app! (I wrote this on April Fools Day, its not a joke (The review I mean))
3	B004KA35D0	the controls are kinda wonky, but u get used to them.  Overall enjoyed. wish there was more replay action. best $1 I've spent on an app!ASUS TF Prime (tablet for those that don't know)
1	B004KA35D0	not really that much fun but watevs buy it if u want btw it isnt that much of a game
1	B004KA35D0	it sounds boring and I didn't even download it. go my way and DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE!!!!!!!PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! IM BEGGING YOU!!!
1	B004KA35D0	I played this app on my friends tablet and i think theres no room for creativity! you have to do exactly what the customer wants. boring!
3	B004KA35D0	well I really haven't played it before but I really wantvto but I really want it to be the free app of the day so please amazon. make this a free app please please then ill rate 5
2	B004KA35D0	Downloaded it .....  played it ....... kept it for 2 months ....... removed it.  But it was fun while it lasted.  Thank you.
1	B004KA35D0	first of all who in the world is Mossy??? And the Hollywood beauty center app is kinda boring after a while and who the crap is Mossy and is that person a plant?????
3	B004KA35D0	Great time management game! Fun, challenging, & Addicting if U liked Sallys Spa & Salon then U  games then U will like this its a similar concept!Graphics are good & plays perfect on K.F.Cant wait for more games like these! Time for more Advanced Mobile!!
3	B004KAL2BC	However I really dont think it's worth the $4.99. It does a lot more than the twitter app does in the sense of easier tweeting with more features.
3	B004KAL2BC	This app has all the features that every Twitter client SHOULD have. I switched from the official app because I was frustrated with the lack of features, especially Twitlonger and list editing. However, I still use the official app on my iPad and Mac. The only thing I'm upset about was having to pay $4.99 for the pro version, which only removes the ads!!!! What a rip-off!!!!
3	B004KAL2BC	Works great. Has a lot of features and always keeps u updated on the latest tweets. Which gets kind of annoying since it vibrates every half hour but you can disable that so its all good in the hood
3	B004KAL2BC	I had another Twitter interface for sometime,but when this one came along...well let's say I gave them THE BIRD!Tweetcaster is the best one I have see thus far!
3	B004KAL2BC	I never really got into twitter, because it just seemed to be a big mess. This app changed my views on twitter. It is so nice the way you can organize your contacts. I would tell anyone interested in twitter or not to huge it a try with thus app. It will change your whole twitter experience. Great job guys.
3	B004KAL2BC	I think it does ok, like being able to categorize, but haven't figured out all the features, maybe then I'll give it a 5 start
3	B004KAL2BC	It works well, updates, nice interface, good integration with read later services, multiple accounts. i don't know what more i would even want at this point.
3	B004KAL2BC	makes tweets from my Droid easy and fun. I would certainly recommend to everyone. great job over all with this app. easy, looks good and fun
3	B004KAL2BC	Over all Tweetcaster Pro is a pretty good app. I use it on my Samsung Stratosphere. I do not really have any problems with it.
3	B004KAL2BC	This app seems like it would be good for people who do alot of tweeting. if you use twitter just to follow, it isnt as friendly as the regular twitter app
3	B004KAL2BC	This is a great app. I'm not a twitter power user, so for me needs it's great, would recommend it.
3	B004KAL2BC	this is a really great Twitter app, but dev hasn't updated this version in a long time. The market version is currently 4.1, while appstore version is stuck at 3.4.2.
3	B004KAL2BC	This is a well designed app. It does everything I want plus a lot more. I'd recommend it to friends.
3	B004KAL2BC	This is easily the best twitter app for android. The most functionality and the easiest to use by far. Coming from tweet deck, this app just flows better.
3	B004KAL2BC	This is the best twitter app completely customizable and all features are accessible.. I. Never get on twitter on my laptop after using this app.. Great job
3	B004KAL2BC	Tweetcaster does everything as advertised and then some. I've used other twitter apps but tweetcaster allows me to set aside tweets I don't want to read without having to unfollow the tweeter. Isn't that grand?Great app.
3	B004KAL2BC	With the recent updates, this is once again my favorite twitter app. Zip it, the ability to view photos within the app and timelines, icons that denote conversations with ability to view them, and the themes are my favorite features.
3	B004KAL2BC	I've tried many twitter apps and this by far my favorite fits clean lines and custombility make it easy to use and the filters to keep political junk out of your feed.
3	B004KAL2BC	There are so many good free or ad-supported Apps for Twitter that I was reluctant to try yet another one. Seesmic was working out very well for me and had won the battle thus far. However, I figured if these guys have the guts to charge $5 for an App like this, either they are crazy or they're on to something. Well, am I sure glad that I gave it a whirl. Within 20 seconds or so of using TweetCaster, I realized that I liked the interface far more than any other that I've tried, but it also was FLYING on my LG Optimus! So, so long Seesmic, we had a good run for a while there...
3	B004KAL2BC	It obtains and displays tweets as any Twitter client does. I like the &quot;zip&quot; feature for hiding messages based on some part of their content. The pop-up list of tweet actions is big and an embedded URL is extracted and presented as a convenient button in the action list.
3	B004KAL2BC	No, I have not tried every Twitter client but have used many of the other big ones...and researched many users.  The only reason I gave this a shot was that it was free.  Glad I grabbed it as this IS my favorite of all the ones I've used.  For me, it is simple to navigate and I do find that I enjoy using Twitter more than before!There are some good free choices but knowing what I know now I would even pay $5 for this.
1	B004KAL2BC	Here is another application that insists on keeping the background service running and starting up at boot. I can see if I have notification enabled it will be necessary but even with all notification disabled it keeps running and refuses to be killed. Sorry not impressed. Uninstall. Samsung Captivate.
3	B004KAL2BC	I've been using TweetCaster for about a year now and I love the options that it has like the custom lists, the ability to see who retweeted your tweets, and focused searches.  I highly recommend this app!
3	B004KAL2BC	This is a really awesome app, especially if you have more than one twitter and want to manage them all at once. IT'S WORTH the money, Cause there's NO adds and it's better service than the free version! (:
3	B004KAL2BC	Thanks for bringing this back! "bring back jump to top! you replaced it with some sort of marketing which is useless. the best part of this app over other twitter apps was that feature."
2	B004KAL2BC	Twicca and Plume are better in my opinion, but this one is OK too. Over-priced compared to better options.To the guy that advised people to only use free apps, who do you think you are? Free Apps are a great idea and all, but the higher quality apps usually always have a price associated with them.Your personal opinion on only using free software is great for you, but it Android wants to close the quality app gap with iOS then people should buy a quality app if it fits their needs.And besides, this one is free today so go get it.
3	B004KAL2BC	Initial download of updated app did not refresh and load latest tweets. Deleted app from my Kindle Fire HD, then 're-downloaded. Had to login again with user name and password--which I expected. Now it's working as it should.  I like the features and interface for this app--for me it's easy to navigate.
3	B004KAL2BC	best twitter app out there! definitely recommend.love the interface, options, pretty much everything about this app.go get it now!
3	B004KAL2BC	I happened to get this as the FAOTD but would now gladly have paid for it. Functions better than Twitter, and by experience more stable than any of the others I've tried. It is well worth the purchase price.
3	B004KAL2BC	Does what it says it does. Has all the necessary features I need. I'm new to twitter but it has been easy to use and set up.
3	B004KAL2BC	Not a single flaw, IMHO. About this twenty-word minimum...ten nine eight seven six five four three two one blast off!
3	B004KAL2BC	I waited about a month while using this app before weighing in with a review.  I am very pleased with it. I am not a Twitter junkie but check it daily for people/groups I care about.  Intuitive, fast, stable and efficient.  I recommend it.
3	B004KAL2BC	Best Twitter app of all and I&apos;ve tried them all.  Got the pro version when it was free in Amazon app market. Love it.
3	B004KAL2BC	I really enjoy this app. It expands on the basic Twitter app in a lot of great ways. Zipping the spammers is nice so you don't even have to look at their tweets.
3	B004KAL2BC	It is a great way to use Twitter via your phone. It is a simple, straightforward, user friendly app. They do regular, as needed improvements. I've never had any problems. I love that it is customizable. Definitely worth owning.
2	B004KAL2BC	Came to leave a review only to find several others saying the exact things I wanted to. The app is great, but it refuses to die. When I tell it to quit, darn it anyway I want it to quit. Unable to stop it any other way, I had no choice but to remove it. Glad it was free today and I didn't pay an outrageous $5 for it.
3	B004KAL2BC	I think this has awesome features that let's me use twitter with ease.  notification choices,lists,retweet with or without comments, lists of options when touching comments
3	B004KAL2BC	Love it. I use it with two accounts and it works flawlessly. I would highly recommend it. It's worth the five bucks.
3	B004KAL2BC	Tried some others &amp; didn&apos;t like. I like this one enough, I actually paid the $5 for it. I find it very smooth &amp; easy to use. A lot of customization is available. Does occassionally get hung up &quot;processing&quot; &amp; have to exit then restart. Hopefully this will get fixed. \nIt is very easy to set so that it doesn&apos;t run in the background. As far as turning off at night - I just use the main Android settings menu to disable all sounds except alarm clock when I go to bed.\nI have an LG Ally, low end phone with minimal RAM or processor speed, this functions perfectly for me.
3	B004KAL2BC	Nice ui and I love having the ability to zip tweets from specific folks without unfollowing them. Would have 5 stars but I find the constant buzzing about new tweets a bit annoying.
3	B004KAL2BC	I got it free so it isn't that great for a simple twitter app.  Lacks in features.  This app is better than seesmic and Twicca is better than those two. Twicca has so many features and its free.
1	B004KAL2BC	cant stop the app from running as a system service.  it uses cpu/ram when it shouldnt be.  annoying at best. app looks nice, but its destroying my battery. will continue to use tweetdeck as my main twitter app on android and my desktop/laptop. Moto Droid.
3	B004KAL2BC	Good app. It allows me to see replies, conversations, and what people favorite. I access my twitter account using this app as opposed to using my laptop.
3	B004KAL2BC	I'm a casual Twitter user who has tried Seesmic, Twidroyd and TweetDeck along with the official Twitter app and basically chose TweetCaster Pro as my Twitter client of choice.  Seesmic was close to being my top pick, but the obscure buttons and extra clicks involved pushed me this way.  Tweet Deck was too cluttered for me, and the official Twitter App should frankly be 1000x better. Twidroyd came with my phone and has a nice feature set but always seemed to be a bit buggier than the other Twitter clients.  Ergonomically speaking, TweetCaster Pro is the one for me-its not perfect, but better (for me) than the rest.  Is $5 too much?  A little compared to other apps, but is $5 really too much to spend on something that you like?
3	B004KAL2BC	Tweetcaster is a solid Twitter app for the Kindle Fire. It has lots of features and surpasses those of Seesmic, my previous favorite. I would have rated this app higher except that the User interface leaves a lot to be desired. Finding and using all the features isn't always intuitive. A peeved of mine is that you can copy someone else's tweets but you cant copy your own after it has been sent.  I like the ability have multiple profiles and the interactions screen is great when it doesn't lock up. The ability to manage lists and advanced searches are very nice features. If you plan to be on Twitter a lot then you will enjoy the Pro, ad free, version.
1	B004KAL2BC	nice to share and read feeds from Facebook and tweeter.  without the hazel of opening more then one app at a time.
1	B004KAL2BC	It force closes 3/4 of the time. It has never worked well on a consistent basis but it has become unusable.
3	B004KAL2BC	by far the best twitter app on android. and the interface layout for honeycomb tablets is just awesome. I love it. I can't wait until the friend cast app is done.
2	B004KAL2BC	This app has a great look, manages separate Twitter accounts and love the zip-it option. But TweetDeck lets me manage my FB, my Buzz and Twitter feeds. Since I like everything in one place, I'm sticking with TweetDeck. If I just wanted Twitter, I'd go with this app though.
2	B004KAL2BC	Autofollow after set up? Never okay'd that with me. The widget is useless as it never updates and doesn't do much other than launch the app- a 4x2 icon essentially. See Plume for a lesson in Twitter widgets. Notifications are hit and miss. UI in the app isn't bad but isn't exciting either. Navigation in the app is easy and the Tweet Filter is pretty cool. Viewing other profiles is easy and has a settings menu icon next to their clickable picture to follow, block, etc. Overall, it's a great starting point but with the problems and it's $5 price tag its hard to justify buying or recommending given all the other cheaper/free options available. For instance, since the widget essentially doesn't do anything you'd have a very similar experience with the free official Twitter app and still have your $5. Until there are some changes and fixes I can't give this more than three stars.EDIT: Autofollow is gone, you now get asked. Glad that was addressed. Widget still sucks- still doesn't update without being opened and the refresh button doesn't refresh.
3	B004KAL2BC	This is the best twitter app.  I've used many different ones when you include my previous palm phone and twitter's web app.  This app is the best.  I especially like the jump to top feature.
2	B004KAL2BC	As far as Twitter clients go, its pretty good. However, there is one major flaw. If I select "exit application" then the application needs to exit! I exited the application and then, several hours later, it showed 10 new tweets. How can it poll for tweets if you exit, right? What that means is the exit does not work and it constantly runs in the background. As a "casual tweeter" I really don't want this thing sucking down my battery life.
2	B004KAL2BC	That's great that this is free today but I hope no one would ever pay for this. TweetDeck is still the best Twitter app out there and works great with Facebook too
3	B004KAL2BC	The Amazon App Store has version 3.1.2 where the Android Market has 3.3. Amazon needs to support faster, more regular updates, or its going to fall flat here
3	B004KAL2BC	I wasn't all that interested in Twitter until I found this app. Now I find myself really getting more into tweeting.
1	B004KAL2BC	Intercepts long-press on Search button, killing access to my QuickDesk access from within TweetCaster.  This breaks my usage model.Fix and I'll re-review.
3	B004KAL2BC	great good worth buying pretty good twitter app if I had to do it all over again I would probably choose this app
3	B004KAL2BC	One of the better Twitter apps! I've tried so many and I find myself coming back to this one. :-)
3	B004KAL2BC	This does everything I would expect a twitter client to do. It has a nice interface and a lot of features. I'm actually using twitter again because of it!
3	B004KAL2BC	I've been using Seesmic for quite a while but when this became available for free I had to give it a shot.  I really enjoy it, and doesn't seem to have the connection problems that Seesmic had a lot of the times.  It is great to be able to put both of my accounts up and to be notified whenever there is a reply or a mention.  I didn't like the fact that by default it announced when there were new tweets, and I follow enough people to get bothered by that in a couple of minutes.  So I killed that feature and it is really easy to use without being bugged to use it every two seconds.Dependable, easy to use, and functional.  What is there not to like?
3	B004KAL2BC	meh. This is my first time even using Twitter, but the interface seems to work quick and smooth. Not bad. Not bad at all.
3	B004KAL2BC	Great twitter app with reliable notifications. I only wish there was a desktop version. I've tried others but think this is the best mobile twitter app. HTC EVO 4G
3	B004KAL2BC	Not a huge tweet guy, but this app is nice. Glad I picked it up as faotd a while back. Easy to use and nice widget.
3	B004KAL2BC	Easy to use and intuitive. Like the formatting options. A lot easier than twitter.  Works great on my Droid X.
3	B004KAL2BC	Ok yes I got this as an Amazon App of the day, but it is the best Twitter app I have used so far including Twitter's the zip it is awesome. the only thing I'd like improved is its memory (where I read last) is not as good as Twitter for Android
2	B004KAL2BC	My favorite Android app.  I tried all the twitter apps and this one is better than the official one.  Well worth the price.  note: I dropped this review from 5 to 3 stars due to improvements in Twitter's own Android app, but for Kindle it's just ok.
3	B004KAL2BC	So far so good. I'm not a huge fan of Twitter but this app may help. I like the background notifications and so far its running flawlessly on my Moto Defy.
3	B004KAL2BC	The widget doesn't go all weird on me like the Twitter app does.  I enjoy all the configuration options this app has.
3	B004KAL2BC	I prefer this over the official Twitter app. The extra polish and features built into the app adds to the experience. fortunately, the devs update the app as needed; so, the app isn't stuck.
3	B004KAL2BC	I like being able to edit rts, and most of the features, but coming back to the same spot where you left off doesn't always work.
3	B004KAL2BC	I like this app it seems to do more than stock Twitter. For me its less about social media and telling people when I use the toilet and more about keeping abreast about what's happening and the news
3	B004KAL2BC	I use a simple criteria when deciding if I like an app or not... does it work or does it not... and this works!
3	B004KAL2BC	It just works....always.  Too many buggy competitors out there.  20 word minimum is nonsense, just nonsense...nonsense I say! (fulfilled requirement Mr. Amazon)
3	B004KAL2BC	better than twitter itself and twitter should take notice. just hope updates keep coming to help keep the bugs worked out when they do pop up.
3	B004KAL2BC	I like this app and use it a lot. I like that it has a Dark theme. I do feel like it lags when scrolling through posts, and I would like to see it make faster overall. Using it on an Evo 4g rooted + setcpu.
3	B004KAL2BC	simply the best and at a price less than a cup of coffee just buy the pro to support the developers.
2	B004KAL2BC	As a twitter client it does the job, but since I loath facebook any app that forces me to look at it's icon on every tweet gets removed.
3	B004KAL2BC	I have used this app for a year and love it! Worth every penny. My fav part is I can retweet with comment. Post pics is very easy. Longer tweets get posted using this app. Happy New Year.
3	B004KAL2BC	I have used this app for the last year and must say it is great I have not had any issues with it
3	B004KAL2BC	I've tried Twitdroyd, Tweetdeck, and the official Twitter app, but TweetCaster is the best app for Android.  (Tweetdeck is best for PCs)
3	B004KAL2BC	...since it was the Free App of the Day and I love it!! Especially the list feature! Definitely highly recommended!
3	B004KAL2BC	Using this on the Thunderbolt, i enjoy this much more than the official application. Like the colour presentation, better layout, just an over all better user experience.
3	B004KAL2BC	Very efficient and simple way to utilize twitter. Only wish I could disable notifications in zipped tweets. Works well with my Verizon LG Vortex.
3	B004KAL2BC	I've been using this app for months now and it's great! I've tried every other app and this one is my favorite. Check it out!
3	B004KAL2BC	The best twitter app PERIOD! Its only been getting better w/ all the updates. I wish they offered Instagram or whatever as a image source as that's what every1 uses now.
2	B004KAL2BC	Love everything about this app except that after the most recent update push notifications clutter my pull down menu.  I like being notified that I have ## of new tweets, but Hate each tweet being listed.Ex.@xxxxx &quot;blah blah blah&quot; (then adds more down the line ending 7-10 down finally saying [+ 15 more]. Clutters up almost the entire menu.Wish there was an option to turn it to simple or detailed descriptions. 5 stars for sure if that wasn't like that.  So if that doesn't bother you it's a very nice app. I haven't had any performance issues that some others have wrote about.Galaxy S3
2	B004KAL2BC	this app would be a lot better if it didn't take up so much memory.  I don't have multiple accounts and don't have any lists and I'm at almost 20 mb of memory. pretty ridiculous. if you don't have much memory on your phone I would skip this app
1	B004KAL2BC	Yes others are right no way to shut it off will check at least every 2 hours For updates. Very visually appealing but has no way to have permanent columns Like in tweetdeck. Also does not really mark unread Tweets it will tell you how many you have but does not designate which ones are unread. I kept it for a few days then uninstalled going to stick with tweetdeck.
1	B004KAL2BC	I think this is the best twitter app. Biggest problem is that it runs in the background and even if you turn off notifications, you can't kill or stop the app.
2	B004KAL2BC	I love this app, the only thing that is not great about it is that the post-to-fb option and login is not working at all. Please fix! Using HTC Rezound on 4.0
3	B004KAL2BC	TweetCaster Pro on my Droid Xgives me back a connection to Twitter that was missingNow I am really getting a lot more out of the folks I follow. Get it for yourself, then follow gratefulfoody. !!
3	B004KAL2BC	I'm not a power-tweeter (thank heavens) but I do love me some Twitter to keep up on my favorite tech-giants... so with TweetCaster I get a top-notch Twitter app that does all the important things well.  Tons of features for an average size app:  skins; lists; navigation, etc.  It's all here!  Bubye Twidroid, TweetDeck, et.Al... Hello TweetCaster!
3	B004KAL2BC	To be clear, I am a previous hater of twitter and completely new to the service. I only dl'd tweetcaster because it was free for a day. I have no idea how it compares to other apps, but I find it easy, fun, and it's designed aesthetically well. The main drawback, as I see it, I am now a twitter user.
2	B004KAL2BC	I like the creative features of this app and the options it gives when you tap on a tweet, but find it difficult to find something as basic as my followers (still haven't found it). It responds quickly and retrieves tweets quickly. The interface is responsive, which is a plus.However, I couldn't get the refresh to work on the widget, and the buttons on the widget were small. The widget really just needs a rework, in my opinion.Overall, it's a fine app with innovative features that doesn't fail to deliver your stream and give you the ability to search Twitter. Widget needs work and I'd like to see the ability to see the ability to see my followers and people I follow become more handy.
3	B004KAL2BC	Probably the best twitter app out there, only negative was recent with path validation certificate which is reason for 4 stars.
3	B004KAL2BC	Great twitter app...totally worth paying for. I love that I can also post to facebook. Works great on kindle fire.
2	B004KAL2BC	Unlike tweetdeck you can't see you facebook stream. You can post to fb but can't see other status updates.  Give me that maybe add foursquare too an this is perfect.
3	B004KAL2BC	I loved the free version of this app, was one of my favorites but the ads were a huge turn off. Now I have the full version and no stupid ads so Twidroyd is out and TweetCaster is in. Wish there was more customization with colors and stuff. Great on Droid X and Asus Transformer!
3	B004KAL2BC	I've used several different apps for twitter and this is the best one hands down. The options are terrific and intuitive and I really like the ability to shun someone's tweets without unfollowing them via ZipIt.
3	B004KAL2BC	I'm still sticking with TweetDeck even though TweetCaster has a nicer interface. I need both Twitter and Facebook in one app.
2	B004KAL2BC	This is the kind of app you bring home to mom. This app is fantastic for the above-average twitter user. The UI is pleasing to the eye, and the controls are intuitive. There is just one little (big) thing about this app: it sucks the life out of your android. It doesn't ever really exit, unless you stop it from the applications menu. I don't mind it monitoring for new @replies, but it is clearly doing something more.
3	B004KAL2BC	realy good twitter app. it has a nice design and good features. I really want INSTAGRAM SUPPORT though. I'd love to view more things without leaving the app.
3	B004KAL2BC	Like some other reviewers on this list, I have tried several different Twitter apps - and this one is the best by far.  It has a better interface than Seesmic, and is less prone to crash than any of the others I've tried on my (admittedly finicky) reader/tablet.
3	B004KAL2BC	I love the new update. everything is contained and seems to work great and better than the original twitter app.
3	B004KAL2BC	I am just getting involved with twitter and have found this app to be the best. the layout is good and easy to read. Amazon is also getting updates through quickly which is a bonus. just 3 days since last updated on android market and already updated here. I think it's worth $5.
3	B004KAL2BC	I really enjoy the Tweetcaster Pro it does not have the advertisements and it has a nice icon to show the detect a gap in your timeline on twitter it is actually really nice. You can customize it with personal colors. The option to zip is also great if you do not want to see someone's tweets in your timeline.
3	B004KAL2BC	TweetCaster Pro is a great Twitter client for your android device.  I have it installed on my HTC Rezound (Ice Cream Sandwich) and Asus Transformer Pad Infinity (Jelly Bean), and it is great on both devices.  I like that the app is smart enough to know whether it is on a phone or a tablet and adjust the way it displays.  The interface is slick, and it has all of the features that you would expect in a full featured Twitter app.  I have tried a lot of different apps over the years for Twitter, and this is the one that I settled on based on user interface, features, and performance.  It is the best of breed, and I highly recommend it.
3	B004KAL2BC	I've recently gotten into the twitter scene and tried all the relevant apps on Android. This is the one I liked best and still use today. I've only had the free app so it will be nice to upgrade and lose the ads. Thanks, Amazon!
3	B004KAL2BC	This is the best twitter app bar none it is fast and astetically pleasing. The amount of customizations allowed on this app are crazy this is a twitter fans dream app.
3	B004KAL2BC	I am not heavy into the use of Twitter, however I have tried a large selection of applications for its use over multiple platforms.  TweetCaster Pro has been the best I have found for the Kindle Fire.  I do use more than a single Twitter account which is the only reason I upgraded from the free version which was more than adequate for a single account User.
3	B004KAL2BC	So I finally stopped trying other products. If you like to tweet, this will work fine with no muss or fuss. Can manage lists & such stuff, works equally well on my motorola photon, Kindle Fire & Toshiba thrive.
1	B004KAL2BC	The app itself is great. clean looks. well designed ui. customizable options for pix, vids and other external media. changeable color schemes and so on. However, the app has a fatal flaw, imo. This app will remain dormant even if you expressly tell to &quot;exit application&quot;. It will stay in the background even after you kill it via Applications settings. That's just bad news. Now with carriers metering data usage and with battery life getting shorter and shorter I dont want an app hogging both unless i tell it to. If they would fix this flaw, this app is at least 4 stars.
3	B004KAL2BC	love how you can create your own lists.  I usually use Plume, but I may be using Tweetcaster now that there is the list feature.
3	B004KAL2BC	Never crashes on my Droid Charge. Lets you save multiple drafts for later. And they added the feature to time-delay your tweets! Best Twitter app out there.
3	B004KAL2BC	I like the midnight background and large fonts. Nice interface on my Nexus One Google phone. Gives notifications and has plenty of alerts. Excellent UI interface and I like the themes it has available.
1	B004KAL2BC	Do not waste your money on this app. It force closes on my phone at least 3x/week &amp; customer support is a JOKE. I have had a ticket open since Dec 2011. Once they have your $$, you are dead to Onelouderapps.
3	B004KAL2BC	If your looking for a tweeting app on the Kindle Fire then this guy is for you. Would I pay $4.99 for it? No! I got it while it was free.
3	B004KAL2BC	nothing bad to say about it. could be better and could be worse but overall a solid app. thanks for reading.
1	B004KAL2BC	I been using this app for over a year and is one of the best if not the best twitter app out there.But now  In the latest update you have removed the option to see twitter link outside of the app in my browser, is there any way i can do that again.Sometime the links are for videos and other media that don't show up within the app browser and i want to have the option to use my ownFor now i will need to use another app that allows me to do thatHope you can get that option back thanks
3	B004KAL2BC	Great app, perfect for all my needs when I am on the move. And it gets better with each upgrade I get.
3	B004KAL2BC	the new update made it amazing. the first time I used it, it wouldn't work. but now that it does I use it everyday.
1	B004KAL2BC	Great app, but don't buy it from Amazon! The Amazon app store is never current with their updates! Blah blah
3	B004KAL2BC	Great app, prefer it over the regular twitter app. You can customize the app by the color theme etc. You can view tweet pics without clicking on the tweet.
3	B004KAL2BC	took some getting used to but like the functionality of it. like the enhancement to include posted photos much nicer then having to follow a link.
1	B004KAL2BC	the app is very well made. deserves 5 stars. nice gui, and everything works well.  i just greatly dislike apps that ask for a rating. here is your rating onelouder!
3	B004KAL2BC	I Had The Free Version, But Updated To The Pro Version, To Get Rid Of The Ads.
3	B004KAL2BC	This app is so much better than the "Official" FB app that it is a real jewel... I think it is faster, looks better, has more options.  I also think it is much more stable.I love it.
2	B004KAL2BC	I can change my profile info, however any time I want to alter it I have to retype the whole thing. for some reason in the edit screen it reverts back to a very old version of my profile.
3	B004KAL2BC	I think the title pretty much covers it! Now that you can post to Facebook and Twitter at the same time, this is the best app!!! Super easy to use.
3	B004KAL2BC	This is the best Android Twitter app I have found. I have been using now for a few years... since it was first released.
3	B004KAL2BC	Rather simple direct and easy to use.  I like the twitlonger and readability integration. with the addition if real time updates to your stream, this app is aces.
3	B004KAL2BC	Not only is it aesthetically pleasing, it's user-friendly, though I wish there was a little more in terms of customization (themes, etc.).  That shouldn't detract from the great features it offers.Two features I'd like to highlight:a) The ability to hide replies on someone's timeline, something lacking in the desktop version.b) Ability to connect to InstaPaper or ReadLater, a bookmarking of sorts for links in tweets, perfect for when reading the article must wait.
3	B004KAL2BC	I've been using this app for 2 years and I, too, have tried them all. Hands down, this really is the best Twitter app; easy to use with great UI! I'm excited to now have the Pro version. I got up early just to get it while the getting was good - FOR FREE! Only other time I get up early is to catch a plane. Yes... This app is THAT good! Lol
3	B004KAL2BC	Does what it should. No real complaints. The splash screen makes me wonder if the program really takes this long to load, or if they just like the picture that much.
3	B004KN420W	The app is fine. Works like it is supposed to and the interface is what you would expect. I am posting this 5 star rating simply to counter balance the lame ignorant folk whom post 1 star ratings thrn write a review that has nothing at all to do with the app.  Amazon really needs to figure out a way to monitor this problem.
1	B004KN420W	this is a bit advanced for what I need. alot of accounting terms and processes. everything has to be keyed in manually on a tiny, unattractive interface. I wanted to like it, the idea is great, but it's just a bit much for the average person.
2	B004KN420W	I downloaded despite poor reviews, I had really high hopes, but it's just not User friendly. it's a great idea but the main screen doesn't make any sense, and liabilities and assets should be set up differently.
3	B004KN420W	I really do like this app.  The only thing, and I know it's been mentioned, is that it is time consuming entering all the information in there.  Not bad though!  Has really helped me with my budget.
2	B004KN420W	This is a decent finance app for tracking your money and monitoring your budget if you don't mind manually entering in all almost all of your data. I have been trying out these finance apps lately to see how they compare to Mint.com which I currently use.Overall the app has functioned very well and I haven't come across any odd behavior or crashes. One really nice feature is the ability to password protect the app to keep unwanted eyes off your finances. There are a lot of catagories to choose from when creating your budget and you can create custom catagories as well and choose from a selection of icons to represent it which is a nice feature. The interface is fairly bland but gets the job done. The app has a reports section which gives you a nice visual snapshot of your financial situation. You can set up recurring bills like rent and cable so you don't have to add them in manually each month.While there are some things I like about this app there is nothing here to convince me to switch from Mint. I really like how Mint automates everything so there is no manual entry at all and I find the features in the Mint app to be more robust. Some people may not be comfortable giving all their log in information to one app like Mint and for those folks this app could be very useful for them.Edit: as other reviewers have mentioned this app has some very questionable permissions. I do not see why the app needs Internet access as there are no auto updates here and you need to manually enter in all your data. Just something to think about before installing.
1	B004KN420W	This app is great for Bill Gates. Not for people like me with real life problems. I really don't know anyone who could get use out of this. Unless your some lame dude trying to pick up chicks with this (lol). If you look at the preview images it has $600 for entertainment and like $30 for utilities. For real????? who did they use for the example? Lil Wayne. And if u have enough money to use this app,  then buy it u cheap skate! Amazon, I love the free app of the day and hate to complain but, give us something we can use. My net worth isn't important to have to look at it in a app all day! Peace!
2	B004KN420W	but I wonder....no import feature? You can obviously export in QIF format, which is great, but what about importing existing QIF files? This would be awesome!
2	B004KN420W	I got all excited when I saw this app saying &quot;money&quot; I thought I was downloading free money so I went out and bought a porche with my life saving. minutes later I didn't get my free money from the free &quot;money&quot; so I went to return the car but the dealership was gone. left with only a field of dirt. I fell to my knees and started to cry.
1	B004KN420W	Financial data plus open network sockets equals potential for an empty bank account, which would make keeping track if your finances very easy.make sure you trust the developers.
1	B004KN420W	whith  all the online, mobile and atm banking we all do this app is old school. you have to type in everything, who has time for that? the graphics on this app looks like some one in grade school designed it. MINT APP IS THE BEST! it links all of your accounts together in one app, show transactions, allows you to rename them if you like, add notes to each tranasction. it keeps traack of your mortage value on Zillow.com.  you can easily merge with tax software to do  taxes. SERIOUSLY THE BEST MONEY APP....MINT;-)
3	B004KN420W	As a certain other certain (pick your own adj here) App does what it says it will do! Five Stars to help balance things due to a certain 'pointless' person!
3	B004KN420W	Todd M, man you should of waited a few but who would know right? anyway this thing it is simple to use and good for the budget control
3	B004KN420W	This is a good app if you are looking to administrate your money seriously, it just woks on Kindle Fire and it is pretty good, indeed.I still prefer easy-money but you can consider this app as well.
1	B004KN420W	This app was not good. Didn't like the GUI, there are better apps out there. Also this is the third finance FAOTD in like a month. I don't need 3 finance apps.
3	B004KN420W	My Device: Kindle Fire.  App Version: 2.3I think some reviewers are being unfair with this app. It doesn't claim to have online sync capabilities, so why rag it for not having it?Works well on my device. Good graphics. If someone wants to track all their finances, a doesn't mind having to enter the data -- this app is for them. I think people with limited or no data (Internet) plan will enjoy this app. Unfortunately, for those people there is no built in tutorial or help (links to the website).
1	B004KN420W	Why would this app's permissions include open network sockets if it's a standalone app? I didn't see anything to indicate it had ads of any kind, so why need the ability to connect to the internet?  It certainly doesn't import any financial data for you to automate any part of the process, so that can't be the reason.  I am very skeptical of utilizing a financial app that, on one hand, lures people in with false security in that the app doesn't need all your passwords and gateway info to operate, but on the other hand, has an open socket for the developer to have access to the sensitive data.  Sounds like a crazy permission to accept, considering the internet access it requires is only communication between your app and the developer, not your financial institutions or creditors.
1	B004KN420W	This app is not at all User friendly. It crashes on my kindle fire.  I waited for it to show up as a free app before trying it out and I am so glad I did.  If the developer wants to fine tune this app and work out the bugs, it could be a decent and useful app.  I gave 2 stars for the concept.  Oh, and I agree...the developers should not pad their own ratings.
1	B004KN420W	top 8 reasons not to pay1 frikin' ugly interface2 no import feature3 tedious to input your info4 no move to card option (in case you dont want widgets on desktop)5 memory hog6 waste of storage7 developer padded reviewsand 8 there are better ones out there like mint.com, which has issues with my bank but its so good that i happily keep it on my phone and check weekly to see if  problem is fixed ;-)
1	B004KN420W	This is not the most pretty or intuitive interface, and since there is no input feature you have to enter everything in manually. That is hardly acceptable on a PC, but try doing that on a phone. It took forever and it felt like I got nothing done. I uninstalled!
1	B004KN420W	Used it for a few minutes and gave up on it... The setup and upkeep are just not as smooth as other apps out there
1	B004KN420W	where are the games? ,  what's with Amazon and business apps lately?, its an ugly app and.doesnt do what I want
2	B004KN420W	It has a hard learning curve. I didnt see any part where you are able to manage  your lemonade stand. Just constant entering of information..where is the button to start the simulation?
2	B004KN420W	This app seems ok but I prefer using programs on my computer with a real keyboard. Putting all the data into such an app can be time consuming and I don't want to do it or even lose my Kindle Fire and lose all of my work.This app works ok and has some nice features (13 expense categories) but it cannot compare to the power of a computer based finance app. I also worry about using a finance app that has unlimited Internet access. I worry what is being shared to the world that I do not know about. Listing all of your credit cards, bank accounts and debit cards seems risky with the internet turned on.I didn't rate it lower because it may be of some use to some people but for myself I will use more secure methods to handle my finances.
1	B004KN420W	even if this is the free app of the day it is still substandard compared to an app like the one mint.com offers. mint does more. they do all the work for you. if the app does not import why does it need access for sending and receiving data?
1	B004KN420W	For the most part this app seems like it would be very useful. For someone with a masters in accounting. Not for the average app user. Some of the settings seem way to complicated. Some don't work at all. Tried setting up a payment as weekly payment and it kept showing up as Daily, not Weekly. I couldn't get it to show as Weekly so I have no use for this app. Good thing it was free.
1	B004KN420W	I feel really sorry for anyone that might have actually paid for this app. It's the cheesiest thing ever. It reminds me of Windows 3.0
2	B004KN420W	It's really no better than other budgeting apps out there.  I wouldn't have paid for it.  Cosmetically, it's not very appealing, but it is functional.  Hence the three star rating.
3	B004KN420W	Sure there are other finance apps that some prefer but that doesn't mean that this isn't a good option.I would have given this 4 stars but gave it five to help offset the nonsense from the unappreciative and entitled dolts.
2	B004KN420W	This helps me manage my money on my kindle which is better than the small screen of my phone. Works well and does not ask you for your bank passwords which I like.
3	B004KN420W	what is left to say.  great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app great app
2	B004KN420W	Wish colors could be changed. Simple to use.  a lot of others for free out there that do the same thing, but this one worth the free ap today to not have to look at those garbage ads. Will take it .
1	B004KN420W	I honestly only got the app because it's not every day I can tweet that I'm downloading money.But the apps permissions are really sketchy.
1	B004KN420W	13 static categories is not nearly enough and I see nothing about sub-categories.  This area should be fully customizable. Not for me.
3	B004KN420W	Ok, I've tried almost all financial management apps and I found it the best.It is the only one , which lets you to add planned events , and the app preforms them automatically on date/time you've set. brilliant feature.The UI it's minimalistic, simple and nice.
3	B004KN420W	This will totally be helpful especially when I get a job. Totally awesome app of the day. I love it.
1	B004KN420W	Respect to all the people that left jokes instead of reviews! I'm a professional software designer. On a closed network I attempted to understand the open socket... The app sends no information. It does in fact accept incoming connection, and it does in fact allow full unfettered access to you're data!To all that reads this. You're ignorance will be your undoing. Your information has a price (google didn't get rich selling stocks!) A hacked Facebook account can auction off for as much as $300.Wake up PPL, this is life where PPL take from you and sell it.
3	B004KN420W	Boy am I glad this came along today. I done filled up the last money managing app Amazon offered a couple of weeks ago and been wondering where I'm gonna store all these extra accounts. And then here comes Money with unlimited wallets. It's about time cause you know folks hittin up the FAotD got more money than they know what to do with.
2	B004KN420W	All i had been seeing was games. Its nice to see other stuff as well from amazon! Hope to see alot more than JUST games.
1	B004KN420W	yep works just fine on honeycomb. it works just fine in portrait mode on a toshiba thrive. but the reason I gave it one star is because of permissions ... there is no reason for it to open a network socket. plus there is an awful lot that this app just doesn't do and there's no point in getting into it but this app is not very good for what you would use it for. There is much better in the market. Due to the permissions there's no way I would keep this app installed on my device anyway - not even for free.
3	B004KN420W	does what it says but personally i need a finance app to have an online account to share with my wife.  at least it has export to external storage but that wouldnt solve my need. if you want to track your expenses in a solo account then this may work for you.
1	B004KN420W	Poor interface, poor features, questionable permissions, just give it a pass and download the mint dot com app. Way better and up to date.
1	B004KN420W	this app is worse than mint but mint is better because it is free this one is not that good don't spend your money on this piece of poop
3	B004KNAS7I	this is the best app of them all you learn about Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for you on the go.  GET THIS APP!!!!!!!!!! And don't forget- JESUS LOVES YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
1	B004KNAS7I	they should ban this application.  It won&apos;t even open at all.  get the other bible application.  It tracks your daily progress and audio works great as well.  look for the other application here.  It&apos;s called holy bible application.
3	B004KNAS7I	I've been reading reading through the Bible for quite some time now. But I always seem to get stuck and lose interest during the shall we say less interesting parts. But with the audio read-along even those "less interesting" parts sound epic!  The voices are great and I love the background music. My only complaint would be that I can't figure out how to change the version.
3	B004KNAS7I	absolutely love hearing the Word read and dramatized. such an incredible blessing. I recommend this to anyone wishing to learn and grow closer to God.
3	B004KNAS7I	Bible.is has provided excellent dramatic and written versions of various versions of the Bible. It is a blessing to us all. RevDrGareth
3	B004KNAS7I	Love this Bible app, It is audio, text, and it even has awesome videos! It needs wifi to run, but you can download verses to view offline. Love it!
3	B004KNAS7I	If your looking for a great app for Bible study or reading, this is what you need. Both, old and new testiment, either buy reading or having it read to you.  I absolutely love it. I can't imagine any better or easier to use.
3	B004KNAS7I	I have always loved &#34;Faith come by hearing &#34; , and this is a great asset to the powerful bible study the already had in place.I would highly recommend it to everyone that is sincere about studying the Word.
2	B004KNAS7I	I have this app on the Iphone 4, and it works great, but it doesn't seem to work so well with my Kindle. It would take a long time for the program to load, and it constantly force-closes. The screen tends to flip and turn regardless of the lock setting, and the audio cuts off every once in a while. I honestly love this app, but I had to unistall it. I hope they fix these problems soon.
3	B004KNAS7I	It dramatically reads through Old and New Testament via the audio. No excuse not to spend sometime in God's Word, even if your busy.
3	B004KNAS7I	It is awesome to have the Word read to me dramatized! I can read along with the characters and it feels like I'm right there in the midst of the action. What's better is that my kids love this app! Thank you!
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a great Bible app with an excellent dramatized audio Bible component. Also the Jesus movie video that is included is nice as well.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a great off line audio Bible except for the fact that the audio cuts off some chapters before there done, and Song of Solomon won't download
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a great app for hearing the spoken word! I like listening with the dramatize Bible versions. You can even download chapters for reading off line.
3	B004KNAS7I	this app is wonderful.  in the morning; when you have no time to do a quiet time and every thing is in chaos this app will still helpyou to be able to spend time with God.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is awesome and is the best bible app ever made. When i heard about that app i download it and absolutely fell in love with it.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this. It doesn't just read it but it's more realistic with background music and different voices. It is dramatized so you feel as if you are there.
3	B004KNAS7I	this app makes staying In the word so easy. I love it and tell everyone I know about it. the audio with the drama is great and helps you keep it in context
3	B004KNAS7I	i enjoy listening to king james version being read to me with special effects.  Genesis the story of the creation is awesome....my daughter and mom enjoyed listening with me too! I will definitely recommend this to my friends.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love being able to listen to the word as it is read with different voices to give clarity to who is speaking.
3	B004KNAS7I	there are several really good Bible aps out there.  this is one of them.  I've been cleaning up my kindle, but this is one of the ape I'm hanging on to.
2	B004KNAS7I	I wanted to have the Bible on my Kindle to make it easier to find passages and such. However, the only thing I got out of this app was a headache. It wouldn't work half of the time.
3	B004KNAS7I	I wanted an audio bible and thought I had it but found it only worked online. This app works! You will have to download every chapter separately to your device. Nice dramatization!
1	B004KNAS7I	I was having trouble with one of my other Bible Apps so I am looking for something new. This has great reviews but I don't share those views. I was given a choice of one translation (ESV)even though I chose the button to view other translations there were none. As to ease of use. None there either. I could get a book and chapter but not fine tune it to a verse. Within 5 minutes of this being on my Kindle I deleted it. Maybe this is good for Android only.
3	B004KNAS7I	i luv this app! it works offline and online, plus it reads me the bible!!!!!!that way i can play games while reading!!
3	B004KNAS7I	I use this every day. I found it to be great when I am on the go. I have recommended it to several of my friends.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is the BEST audio Bible app. I have heard. You can buy the spoken Bible for a lot more but why? You will love this app. A note....you must have a wifi signal or hotspot, like a coffeehouse, to listen to the Bible OR have space in memory to download each chapter, paragraph or line. Then listen to it anywhere. Downloading is easy but takes space. That said I would recommend this app to anyone.
3	B004KNAS7I	Total drama and audible!  I dearly enjoy this feature on this and "hearing is believing" it's just so...notes can be made in depth on it which is what I found by accident!  Highlight and have fun!
3	B004KNAS7I	i loved this app it has all the books of the bible all you have to scan through and find the book you want to read the only problem i had is that i couldn't always get it to work but when it did work it was very useful
3	B004KNAS7I	This is the best Bible app ever :3 when ever I can't focus on reading I just get my kindle and listen.  There's no problems with it either :D u should really try it...if u don't have it and love it already :PGod Loves U ;)~Caraline
3	B004KNAS7I	I was pleased to find this app.  It has really put things in a new and positive perspective for me!!
3	B004KNAS7I	I enjoy this app. It allows me to listen to gods word through the tone of the reader. Reminds me of read along when I was in public school
3	B004KNAS7I	LIKE THIS APP ALOT.  IT READS THE SCRIPTURES TO YOU.  YOU CAN LEARN THE HARD NAMES OF PEOPLE IN THE BIBLE.  GOOD APP.
3	B004KNAS7I	I'm so busy, kids, full time job and everything else in between! Listening to the bible has really rejuvenated my faith which I've been dying to do! Thanks!
3	B004KNAS7I	I like this bible.  You can change the translations.  Just with you could only highlight the words you want not just the whole line.  Also would like to download it so you dont have to have the internet.
3	B004KNAS7I	Bible.is gives a convenient opportunity to listen to the Word of God while moving through your day. Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God. The text is not as easy to read at times. It doesn't flow like easy reading text would flow in an e-reader format. The words appear to be crammed together. Good app.
1	B004KNAS7I	I felt like that I would really enjoy Bible.is, however, it kept force closing or if I was able to open it, then there would be nothing there on the screen.Tracie
3	B004KNAS7I	I can now follow along with the lesson really good in church. Really fast to get the verses you need!
3	B004KNAS7I	I love to read God's inspired Word. This gives me that opportunity, for which I will be Eternally grateful. Open the pages, and read it. Don't let it collect dust!
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a fantastic app and is such a blessing to our family.  With this app (Dramatized ESV read along with the audio) my four kids are spending more time in The Word!
3	B004KNAS7I	Great Bible app. Will even read the Bible to you.Very nice app and it's free. Have a few problems watching the videos on my smart phone.But worth it just for the Bible.
2	B004KNAS7I	Well, of course this is a nice Bible to read but it is not set up to use with my Kindle Fire. So, I was disappointed. You cannot use it the same as one that is KF friendly. What I do like about it is that the name of the Chapter is on the top of each page. But navigating through it is not very good. Sorry.
3	B004KNAS7I	I like the fact that it reads aloud to you, and there are so many versions to choose from. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I haven't been able to figure out how to use it in places without wi-fi
3	B004KNAS7I	Super app! I get more from listening than reading and really enjoy ability to backup and listen again when you need too. Would gladly buy this at reasonable cost if it had basic cross reference capability.
3	B004KNAS7I	This Bible app s great for someone who wants to rest their eyes, or listen to the words read to you while driving or working around the house or yard. It is a big improvement over other reading software in that it is normal voice inflections and not computer generated monotone. It takes a small effort to get used to the readers voices as they read the different parts. Soon however, you forget that and get immersed into the story or text.  I recommend this wholeheartedly.
3	B004KNAS7I	A great Bible app if you want to hear the word of God being read.  I like the tone of the reader's voice.  This app also has videos that are great for any age!
3	B004KNAS7I	Reading the bible can be challenging at times; especially the King James version (my personal favorite), this app has taken the challenge away. It reads the verses to you with or with out the dramatic sounds effects. If you plan to read the good book this app is wonderful. It has several different Variations of the bible from ESV (2001, English Standard)  to the 1989 NRS (New Revised Standard) and of course the King James Version or KJV. I love this app and I pray that God blesses all that use it.
3	B004KNAS7I	I have found the Bible is app to be very useful at work because I am able to listen to scripture while there and learn the real knowledge of Jesus Christ and the plan God has for mankind and real world history.
1	B004KNAS7I	but it only works when your wifi is on, you can't even read without wifi, wifi isn't available everywhere, like in my car, or on a camping trip, which is why I wanted it to take camping. it isn't very useful like this.
3	B004KNAS7I	In class a goal of ours is to read the whole new testament in a year. This app works great foot that kind of stuff. I can't just read the Bible. My eye  just skim over the page. This reads to you and you can follow along! This is the best audio Bible app ever!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	The dramatic readings of ESV (and other translations) are great.  Now, there are even video's of the Bible included... thought obviously, not a word-by-word video.  Granted, now YouVersion and others have audio capabilities, but Bible.Is is still the best.
2	B004KNAS7I	I really do not like this Bible App?? I do not use it very often f at all. It is not what I was looking for for reading purposes.
3	B004KNAS7I	I've Been searching for a long time for a good Bible app. And I think I finally found One.. Thanks
3	B004KNAS7I	Such a great help. Having various translations side by side. My faith  grows and grows closer to my Lord and Savior Jesus. Listen and seek new insights daily in print and voice.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app because now I never miss reading/hearing the word.  I can read it pretty much any where any time and when I am not able to read, such as when I am cooking or perhaps taking a bath, I can turn on my app and listen.  It is very user friendly for anyone.  I can highlight passages, make notes, bookmark pages.  It is just wonderful and a I am so thankful to the developer of this app!  I have spread the word to everyone I know about this app!
3	B004KNAS7I	Because I love the Word of the Lord and it increase my knowledge on howmy Heavenly Father want us to be on this earth, I wish it was more peopleLove the Bible like I do, and try to be a doers and not just a hearer.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a really great app! You not only get to listen to the Bible, but you get the Jesus movies too!  I HIGHLY recommend this terrific app.
3	B004KNAS7I	I am currently using the 40 day program of this app.  It is not the exact app I was hoping for.  I have to download before using it away from WiFi if I choose to, but that takes too much space on my Kindle.Maybe I'll find what I need later on.  In the meantime, all I can say is that its a pretty good app.
3	B004KNAS7I	This app is so helpful. I love it so much. I also love that when I am at school I can read it without internet connection as long as I download it. I can also listen to the audio without internet as long as I download it.
3	B004KNAS7I	Best program ever. Does more than the description tells you it does. Easy to use and have lots of versions of the bible available. Two thumbs up!!
3	B004KNAS7I	For people on the go, this application is a great tool.  Enjoyable, encouraging, edifying; it's an excellent way to stay engaged with the Word of God!
3	B004KNAS7I	What an incredible app! It is easy to use. High quality recording and the sound FX are awesome! You can actually watch the Jesus. Film Not to mention it is FREE!
3	B004KNAS7I	Not only can I read this myself but I can have it read aloud to me has all the books although I sometimes read my hand bible this app is a must have you can also watch movies from this app pertaining to the bible it also helps me pronounce words and names in the bible and get meaning of them research this app is awesome I definitely recommend this for everyone there is a lot you can do with this app try it for yourself and see a must have
3	B004KNAS7I	I like having the option of listening and/or reading the scripture.  It makes it easier to follow having the different voices for the individuals instead of just one voice reading continuously.  There is also a selection you can choose to make notes as you go along, however I have not used that part yet.
3	B004KNAS7I	I don't honestly use this app all the time but I should use it more. I learned of this app as my son and I were comparing Bible apps. This is an audio Bible. I use when I don't feel well, like a headache or something that tries to steal my time w the Lord. But, if you are interested in keeping evil on the run, play this app in the background. Satan and his minions despise God's Word so they will flee. One of my favorite things about this app is if are in love with like Psalm 39 and you want to download that chapter to your device to play like a music file you can. Awesome, thank you Faith Comes By Hearing!!!!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	we love the bible and they should make more of it we believe everyone needs the bible and the teachings are great
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a great app when ya wanna look a verse up quick its simple. Also wonderfully for reading scripture anywhere you go the Bible goes with you and it even has audio so you can listen and relax. I recommend this to everybody who reads the Bible!!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	A Friend told me about this app during a Bible study. I came straight home and downloaded it. I loved it so good that I called my Mom and told her and she downloaded it. She loves it too. Several more of my friends said they have the app too. If you are looking for a Bible app that you can listen to and read the text at the same time....here it is!!! Download and enjoy God's Word.
3	B004KNAS7I	Sound is good. The bible verses matches the kjv bible if you're looking for a bible on the go this it u can higlight bookmark and save notes. You can let it read to u or read it yourself and everytime u open it back up it on the chapter where u left off at.
3	B004KNAS7I	Wow !what a great app I read it daily, everyone should, what a way to start the day by reading God's word.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is the bible on your smartphone. Easy to read, also its in my favorite language.It has a mode for hearing any part of the bible.Its great companion when in need of some words of hope.Works with Samsung galaxy s2 and Ramos w12 tablet.
3	B004KNAS7I	it nice not having to lug around a large book this is great
1	B004KNAS7I	Only offers 3 versions of the Bible.  The dramatized versions on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being fantastic are about a 5 or a 6.  I am grateful that there is background music and the voices are not monotone.  The narrarator is descent in Genesis 1 but God's voice sounds like a 25 year old college student.  I know it's free but if you're going to go to the trouble and use of technology...make sure you have the talent behind it.  Come on people it's God's Word...do a better than adequate job!  ( &bull;:
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app. I listen to the Bible while I am cleaning or cooking and it is riveting. It holds my attention and helps me with my goal of reading and studying the Bible. I love that I can choose the King James Version to listen to also. This app is awesome.
3	B004KNAS7I	i really like this app! very easy to use and the audio is great. it is nice to see the spreading of God's word is still Free for some people. a+++
3	B004KNAS7I	ok... this app can go on mostly any divice. exsamples, ipad android almst anything!!! its also great to have this because if u went to church, with ur kids, and u don't go there no more because u have to work, get this and let them play this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! u give it to them durring work!!!!! and, it can read for u!!! so say u can't see, it will read to u if u press the button!!! but, there is one thing i hate.... on some lines, there will be a song, with the words, ahhh... so u think, &quot;so?&quot; well, when that happends, u can't hear the word what they are trying to say!!!!!! so thats why its 4 stars.
3	B004KNAS7I	This has got to be the BEST Bible app EVER! I love listening to it almost on a daily basis.  I plan on listening to the entire Bible, and when I'm done, I'll start at the beginning and listen to it again, for it is The Greatest Story Ever Told! I'm sure many will like this app as much as I do.
3	B004KNAS7I	I think it is awesome because I can do anything I want and I can here it so I don't miss a thing.
3	B004KNAS7I	Thank you for getting the word out. I have another Bible app on my kindle, but the reading of this is far better.
2	B004KNAS7I	Love this app. Only thing that would make it better is if they wouldn't make all the women SO whiny. Men's voices are ok, but most of the woman's are SO whiny. It's annoying. Queen Esther wasn't a beggar, so why make her sound like one?
3	B004KNAS7I	This has everything you want in a bible app. Easy navigation. Of course you can go audio and listen to the scripture too.
3	B004KNAS7I	I can't recall how I came about downloading this app. I assume that I was looking for a certain version of the Bible for my Kindle and I was looking for one that was free. The description of this app seemed to meet my needs so I 'purchased' it. Imagine my surprise when I used it for the first time.First of all, I was amazed that they had different versions that were dramatized that you could listen to. No stale reading of the powerful word of God. Then, the delight I felt increased when I found that you could download the recordings onto your Kindle and have them to listen to even when you were away from internet! That, in itself, is amazing.Tonight, I sat down and continued through Isaiah. Upon opening my Bible, I thought, "Hmmm, I should let the Bible.is app read it while I follow along in my Bible. I started where I had left off last, in Isaiah 3, intending to read one or two chapters. The vivid imagery and the dramatic reading made it difficult to stop! And, you don't have to advance to the next chapter as the app does so itself, changing the 'page' and starting the reading without you having to do anything!The fact that this app is free and offers so many benefits is stunning! Add to this that you can also watch the Jesus Film right there on your Kindle! And, it is broken down, so you can watch parts or all of it as you need to. That was yet another pleasant surprise. :)You can also click on a Scripture and it takes you to a screen where you can make notes and it doesn't interrupt the narration. This app works wonderfully. I wish I had discovered it sooner!I know there is a great deal more that this app has to offer and I can't hardly wait to discover the different uses that Bible.is has for the believer. I highly, highly recommend this app to any Christ-follower and to those that are wondering what is so great about being a Christian...just a few times listening to God's word and watching the film will change your life dramatically and open your eyes to the wonder that is being in a relationship with the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the Savior of us all.Thank you!
3	B004KNAS7I	you can play it by your bedside!  I love the Jesus film option!  it is so worth it and it is free!  thank you app makers!
3	B004KNAS7I	If this app had a couple more versions of the Bible in English (I.e. NASB, NKJV) I think all I would do is keep this on constant repeat. I love the ability to choose a dramatic reading of the Bible. It really brings the words to life. I feel blessed to have this app and I believe you will enjoy listening to the Word.
3	B004KNAS7I	With this app I lay in bed enjoying treasured inspirational life giving words...effortlessly.  A must have for any one wanting to enjoy God's Words.
3	B004KNAS7I	you can take noteschoose what type of Bibleand it reads to youthey have 2 options for autoreadingdrama and non - drama
1	B004KNAS7I	I never looked at this app.  I found the &#34;You&#34; version of the Bible and I love it.  It's not that I don't like this one, I just found one I like better.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is one of the best bible apps I've got on my Kindle Fire.  It has good sound and not that computerized sound.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this Bible. I like to listen to it in the morning while I knit or crochet baby hats for my charity group, Stitches From The Heart. The narrative is so good and the different voices are awesome. I highly recommended it , in my opinion it is more of a 20 plus star rating..
3	B004KNAS7I	This was exactly what I was looking for. I get to read the Bible in all my 4 languages and it is beyond comforting. I downloaded the 4 languages I needed and now I'm just enjoying being able to choose in what language I want to read that day :)
3	B004KNAS7I	nice way to read and listen to.comintators are easy to listen to and a enjoyment in learning about the bible
3	B004KNAS7I	so easy to use and love how u can download the bible for offline usage. I have found having this app has made my private devotionals very easy.e.
3	B004KNAS7I	this is a really helpful app to me,and i know itll be helpful and a hand full of blessings for who ever gets it
3	B004KNAS7I	I have read the Bible all my life and just completed reading it all. Now it is nice toto sit down and listen to it. I love the Bible it is the greatest book ever written.
3	B004KNAS7I	Bible.is awesome! is dramatised! A.w.S.o.M.e!! awesome awe some awesome awe some awesome awesome awe some awe some awesome awe some
3	B004KNAS7I	My husband have been looking for a Bible app that not only has different versions, but also a study guide. This app has fit the bill.
3	B004KNAS7I	What a great way for you to study God's word. Just listen and learn. This is an easy way to memorize verses. Just listen as you drive or exercise.
3	B004KNAS7I	This app is awesome! I use the option for it to read to me as I follow along. Amazing! The drama reading is my favorite. It helps me alot. Wouldn't want to do without this app. Thank you!!!!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	I simply love this app.... I don't know how to use it off-line yet or it I can.But so far I have listened and built my faith. I have listened and read and got even more...just wish I could figure out how to use off line...
3	B004KNAS7I	I downloaded this after it was recommended to me by a friend. I love the narrated version - very easy & fun to listen to. However, it messed up my Kindle Fire - I couldn't get the home button, go back, etc. to show on the screen. So, sadly, I deleted it. I missed it, so I got it again. Now I listen to it from the Cloud, and it doesn't cause me any problems.
3	B004KNAS7I	The best free bible app on the android market. I highly recommend this app to anyone. I love this app.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app because it has excellent programs to keep you in your word daily and I love the dramatically read scripture. It is one of my favorite apps.
3	B004KNAS7I	I am absolutely blessed with this app of the Bible.Thank you Lord for this and God bless the ones who put it together. I absolutely love it.  God bless you.  Linda Lane
3	B004KNAS7I	Its amazing that this app is free. The publishers should be humbly admonished for such a great sacrifice.The app itself is well designed and has an interface that is easy to navigate while maintaining a polished look. Time was taken to make this app.Of course you can read the Word of God in this app... but the fact that you can LISTEN to it being read in a dramatic format is wonderful to say the least! It really can make the words of our God pop out in a dynamically when intaking them audibly in this way.Pros: can read the bible, can listen to the bible (dramatized), can download your desired chapters to listen to offline, can watch dramatizations of your favorite sections of the Gospels, extra maps &amp; notes, can make your own notes.Cons: the only con I can think of is if you don't have this app installed on your phone. That simly means you can't put it to use and reap its benefits! Its a really a well designed, great resource to enhance your personal studies.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love that I can take my bible on my Kindle, and this has features that I have not even used yet!  Mostly, I have been reading through the bible on this app, and it holds my place and opens to the chapter I last left, so it's easy to get to where you need to be.  Easy to look up chapter and verse as well.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app!  It gives two sensory inputs at once (visual and audible) this helps me to retain mord of what I read.  The multiple languages offered makes this one of the most useful apps for sharing Gods word.  You need to try this app. you will love it.
3	B004KNAS7I	I have this on my laptop, phone and kindle. I love the easy access of the written and audio Word of God.There was a glitch in the download, I had to refresh kindle a few times for the icon  to pop up but once it did it was a snap after that..
1	B004KNAS7I	It breaks my heart that this didn't work for me.  I tried four times to use this app before giving up.  It sounds like it would be a great app.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app!  Not only can you choose your bible and your language, but the dramatization makes you feel as though you are right there in the midst of the great flood, the Garden of Eden, Jesus' sermon on the mount and everything else! I love to listen with headphones because it blocks out all outside noise and make the experience even greater. When in the New testament, a small icon appears on the bottom right of your screen and tapping that icon brings whatever Jesus is doing to life in film too!  I listen to this every night and in the daytime when I can, I also read along many times. AND IT IS FREE!
3	B004KNAS7I	Can't say enough good things about this app.  It can be used as a audiobook and reads the bible to you.  I used it to read through the bible in a year.
3	B004KNAS7I	So convenient listening to the Bible while multitasking sometimes or when just relaxing. Bible really comes alive, guess that's why they call it &#34;The Living Word Of God&#34;. With all that's happening around the world today, this is really a great book to read or listen in these troubled times when you need answers.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love the fact that every character has their own voice. the sound effects and music make you feel like your really there.
3	B004KNAS7I	Have been using app on droid and now kindle fire. it has helped with names that I could not pronounce. the videos are great to watch. I pick a chapter and listen as I drift to sleep.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is fantastic! The audio really brings the bible to life. I listen to several chapters while doing the dishes. I use it during bible study, my kindle is much lighter than a bible and I can switch chapters very easily. I have only watched the first video and it is very well done, so I would watch more. If you are picking out a bible app I highly recomend this one!
3	B004KNAS7I	I have been looking for a app like this one for a long time I use this app every day I have it on my phone and tablet kindle fire love lt Thank You do So much.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is even better than finding a radio station (although I can't livewithout my Christian music)!I just wish that there were more versions of the Bible.
3	B004KNAS7I	you are helping soooo many people. i am enjoying this app and than the Lord for the creating of it and the creators, designers and
3	B004KNAS7I	The reading texts, video and audio are excellentt. When I'm doing housework, I can still listen to the Bible verses.
3	B004KNAS7I	I highly suggest this app for people who want to learn more about religion of God ' Jesus ' and more from the Bible.
3	B004KNAS7I	i downloaded the Chinese language version of the Bible so i could brush up on my language skills. the dramatized audio feature is a great tool for learning new characters and reviewing familiar characters because you can follow along with the text as you listen to the reading.  the incorporation of the Jesus film is also great for practicing your listening skills; you can read the text first and then watch the corresponding movie clip.the only complaint i have is that even the extra large text was not big enough for me to be able to see the characters clearly.  other than that, the other features (note-taking, sharing) are great and very useful.
3	B004KNAS7I	The Bible.is an excellent book. movies, reading to you if you want very interesting way of doing to keep your interest on the Word. I would recommend this one to everyone.  Put it on do your housework or other thing's and hear the Word of God.
3	B004KNAS7I	this is pretty good if you are looking for some in depth studying of gods word, I do wish it was more complete but it is good
3	B004KNAS7I	Awesomeness most books with the word of God is good, but this one ivery helpful and in-depth and very much insightful!
3	B004KNAS7I	This app is easy to use and very enjoyable.  I would recommend it to anyone as a Bible source. Work very well with my Kindle.
3	B004KNAS7I	this app I the best Bible app, way better then youversion. youversion allows you to create a profile and plan's.  this app contains Bible movies for certain chapters. it also reads aloud, but with background music and sound effects.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this book/app the being able to actually hear the music lightly in the background helps you better understand what is going on in the story like in movies when the music changes you know something is about to happen. The narrator/reader has a very clear voice and voices change if different characters are speaking like when he is reading God or Jesus lines. It was like watching a movie but only hearing it.You can pause it and take notes as needed and you can click on verse and it takes you to it as he still reads.The only thing is you have to be connected to the internet to listen to it unless you download it and you have to do that  by books of the bible or chapters or verses.Overall I love this App/book it is great if you can;t read well or fall asleep reading or can't understand the bible KJV it is like a amplified reading so that it comes out in story context.I read it and double checked it with my KJV bible it is not far off at all really.100% satisfied
3	B004KNAS7I	absolutely love it. it works perfectly. it sounds perfect. couldn't get any better. I would buy it, if it costs money. if your stuck on whether or not to get this, get it!
3	B004KNAS7I	Very satisfied with this program.  The audio comes only in the ESV, which is O.K. for me.  It says they are working on other versions.  The printed portion of the Bible comes in several other versions also.  There are different voices depicting each character so you know a different person is saying something.  The voices are easy to understand and they use good diction and project their voices well.  I sent them a contribution and would definately download this program again.
3	B004KNAS7I	So nice to fall asleep listening to God's Word.  This is such a lovely app and it gives you choices of your language and which version of the bible you want to hear.  You can even compare versions, if you like. I recommend this.  Faith comes by hearing.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a great bible it has a lot of version's you should get it it's free. John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.(KJV)Do you know that if you die today that you will got to heaven or hell make that decision today because there might not be a tomorrow.God bless.
1	B004KNAS7I	Wanting to Read contacts info' is very intrusive and not appropriate - I have lots of apps that were free but none that require this permission.Too many permissions period.All companies make apps for profit but getting one's personal info from phone is not about profit but about privacy invasion.Apps with purchasing within rather then just paying up front, I also don't like and I still have lots of apps free without this. When I like an app and want full features then I buy the full version and am done with added costs.I went with the kindle Esv and a touchbible app instead.
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this Bible app because the readers read it with feeling. It's as if you're listening to a play being acted out and it brings so much more meaning to the words that are in front of you.
1	B004KNAS7I	sits in memory and has access to who knows what. have to kill app is only way. most other apps don't have to. could be malware.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is by far the best app for Andriod &amp; iOS and it's FREE!  I'm running it on my phone &amp; all my tablets. This Bibe.is app will also read the bible to you as well as show you videos for the main events in the bible. That's just a fraction of what this awesome app does. Please download it for yourself and check it all out. You're going to love it and you'll always have your bible with you. It's well worth a donation if you're in a position to do that. Have a wonderful day and thanks for this useful tool!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	This app is awesome. I use as a teaching tool while I am sleeping with my headphones in my ear. This even has video's to visually help you learn the bible
3	B004KNAS7I	I love this app!!! Very useful, helps me have the word with me at all times... :-) Great to hear the word while driving and hear the word while you are reading too. I use this app everyday and you can too...
3	B004KNAS7I	I listen to this Bible during my daily commute.  A very good use of my time.  The reading is accompanied by music and dramatic background sounds, making for interesting listening.
1	B004KNAS7I	I didn't know you need internet with this app. I want Bible I can use any where.
3	B004KNAS7I	This is a wonderful app.  We love that you can both read and listen at the same time.  We love the dramatized version. !!!
3	B004KNAS7I	Yes I would truly recommend it.It's very available when I want toread my bible. And easy access to it.
3	B004KNAS7I	While it took awhile to understand how to use this it is wonderful. I use this in my Bible studies along with the Bible its self.
3	B004KNAS7I	Easy 2 use. Read or audio or both. Multiple Bible versions. Excellent extras. Easy to use. Best Bible program I have used in the last 10 years!
3	B004KNAS7I	best Bible apps out there. I get my Bible in now when in on the go. and the kids.enjoy the vizier clips, it bring the Bible life for them. great job! and thank you.
3	B004KNAS7I	I downloaded this app specifically for the audio bible function and I love it. I do so much driving each day and it has been awesome to just turn that on. I also like that there is a dramatized version which makes it easier to stay focused. I haven't checked out the apps other features yet, but if you are looking for a way to easily listen to Gods Word, this is a great option.
3	B004KNAS7I	This app is amazing! I think it makes reading the Bible so much easier to understand. I really like the cartoons too.
3	B004KNAS7I	well as a first time do bible study im still trying to understand it all and what it doesalot to learn about this app
3	B004KNAS7I	If you are looking for something to read while listening to audio-version, then this is the app for you. This is not the sort of thing I was looking for. I was looking for something that had more study-qualities instead of straight reading.
3	B004KNAS7I	I've had this app for awhile now and am enjoying it, I'm so glad I came across itI &#34;m still trying to learn all of the features it has, but really only use it as my audio bibleI listen to it at night before going to sleep, so God's word is in my thoughts throughout the night.If your looking for a free audio bible with drama, this audio bible.is for you!!!!
3	B004KNAS7I	I love having the word of God at hand. It's been helpful to have such easy access to his word as I go about my daily life.
3	B004KNAS7I	Great audio Bible. Enough Bible version avaiable. Only negative is I think you must have access to net to read Bible. The audio can be downloaded to listen without internet access.
3	B004KNAS7I	I like the fact that it have videos. I've never had a video bible. Thank you for this nice app.
3	B004KNAS7I	I JOY LISTENING TO THE BIBLE MY EYE SIGHT HAS GONE BAD. THANK FOR THIS APP. FROM THOSE OF US WHO CAN NOT SEE AS GOOD ANYMORE.GOD BLESS..
3	B004KNAS7I	I read my bible every morning,  and this app is helps me. It goes to the chapter where I left off. I really enjoy the Jesus little snippet movies!
3	B004KNAS7I	I've been using bible.is for years now, the dramatized bible is on my laptop and my phone. The app is on my phone, tablet and kindle (if you're out limit your listening to preserve your battery). The dramatized bible is very clear, and at times reveal things that I've missed. Read, pause, rewind or forward while listening, it's a must have.
3	B004KNAS7I	It is very good and you can keep your place and not have to worry about where you left off. I have been reading it every day and I am most pleased with it.
3	B004KNAS7I	Like this BIBLE.IS. easy n useful can find different studies i need and the audio is clear also n enjoyable
3	B004KNAS7I	Bible.is is a great app that pulls up quickly.  I was looking for an app with audio and was dramatized and Bible.is fits the bill. So I can read, listen and experience the lesson all at the same time! You can also download some of your favorite books to read and listen to offline. I also enjoy the Jesus Film, which brings the Bible to life and the visual quality is great! There are a number of reading plans, and other functions you can take advantage of. I am enjoying this app. Bless the team that put it together.
3	B004KNDU8W	I don't always see those high point words in our scrabble games. This helps find those odd words and a few extra points
3	B004KNDU8W	This app amazing! If you open the app first, then open the word game (wwf) it will run on the device toolbar and can be opened and closed as needed while you play. Some of the words suggested are not acceptable words on wwf so I deducted a star from my rating for the dictionary.
3	B004KNDU8W	It does what it advertises. The free version does have a limitation, but most of us won't mind. Quick and easy to use. Well worth FREE!
3	B004KNDU8W	works good . had to get use to it , alittle different than the app I used on my Android phone but works just about the same . It does the job for me . I am using it for crossword puzzles
3	B004KNDU8W	this is a great product for anyone who plays words with friends! I have found it most helpful. now I have gone from winning almost no games to winning everyone!
3	B004KNDU8W	I like that it stays open or active until I close it. its helpful during my Words with Friends games.
3	B004KNDU8W	Say for example you've arranged a game of Words With Friends with your Facebook-handicapped Old Aunt Gladys. Now for the sake of argument, let's also say you've convinced her to bet your inheritance, which would've previously been bequeathed to you in her will... It amounts to about $10,000. Here's the catch: You can't spell your way out of a plastic shopping bag! What to do?!? Fear not! Just download this app, and you'll be on your way to the Bahamas in NO TIME! What; with words like "HECTARE" (anagram of 'CHEATER'); and "RESLATE" (anagram of 'STEALER'), you'll be slurping on margaritas in no time at all!
3	B004KNDU8W	at first i didnt know what to expect but it was just what i needed to help me in my games with my friends
2	B004KNDU8W	It was just easier to use my smarty brain then to jump back and forth between apps. No reflection on the app, it was fine as frogs hair but I was just too lazy to jump through hoops.
3	B004KNDU8W	This app is simple to use and works great for multiple word puzzles. I highly recommend it! You won't be disappointed.
1	B004KNDU8W	I have already uninstalled this app from my kindle. Not worth getting even if it is free. Try something else.
3	B004KNDU8W	I'm not very good at playing scrabble, so this app saves me from sure humiliation.  :) I use it every time I play word games.
3	B004KNDU8W	This is a good help for word games like Scrabble and Words with friends.  When I get stuck I use it for idea to find words.  The only thing I can' t find is the menu and exit.  ??
3	B004KNDU8W	Another good game for the brain, especially if you don't need a Mensa game. 6 more words required. Why? Why?
3	B004KNDU8W	I use this application often when I get stumped coming up with words. Great help in playing words with friends, doing a crossword, or playing almost any other word game.
3	B004KNDU8W	Works exactly as designed. Not sure I like that it shows in my Kindle Fire's notification area though. Definitely is a cheat if you don't tell your opponent. Some of my buddies use. Some don't.
3	B004KNDU8W	Works good but falls short when playing the game, also it quickly takes the fun out of the game itself.
3	B004KNDU8W	A real help in solving puzzles. Fun to see what words can be developed.I still lose at scrabble but this is fun.
3	B004KNDU8W	If you play any of the word apps, this is a must have. I found it much easier to use than other wordhelpers.
3	B004KNDU8W	this app is a great tool! so very easy to use and I love that they lay out the words for you by length. wish it worked with more than 8 letter though. /
3	B004KNDU8W	This is an nice app for scrabble and wwf lovers, however you will be to tempted to cheat with it.  I use it to solve the NY times crosswords.
1	B004KNHHOU	...and that part of my life I spent listening to just plain dumb stuff. Un-Installed after what seemed like hours of disappointment (but was actually about 5 minutes) which I could have done something better, like get kicked in the nuts. I figured you can&apos;t go wrong for the price.\nBoy, was I wrong.
3	B004KNHHOU	I'd give it five stars, but I'm comparing it to every bikini carwash in every movie that has them.  Cool hand Luke has these girls beat, but it IS a very fun and relaxing app. It plays well on my kindle fire, and I would gladly try a new version.
1	B004KNHHOU	Despite the 1,500 tone headline the reality is I did not find one I liked.  Poor selection.
3	B004KNHHOU	I LOVE ALL THE RINGTONES WITH THIS APP!I have a lot to choose from.As always very easy to download. Thanks Amazon!
1	B004KNHHOU	This app will only allow you to download and assign one ringtone. If you want to assign a ringtone to multiple contacts that you select, or assign different ones to multiple contacts, it will not work. The only thing this app will allow you to do, is assign one ringtone as a default for all of your contacts and incoming calls. Not worth the money.
3	B004KNHHOU	nothing fancy works great on kindle fire.hot girls.makes me smile seeing them work hard to keep my screen clean.veronica is best.
1	B004KNRWAO	Beautiful, Amazing, Smooth, yet frustrating. It has so much potential but it crashes sometime into level 1-2, tried several times, each time the same. I can only really play level 1-1 and survival. The auto pause is broken pauses frequently and randomly makes gameplay simply not possible. Luckily it can be disabled, but does not fix the main issues.
3	B004KNRWAO	I've had harsh feelings about Android games lately, because many of them don't feel like games.  They play more like someone's programming project.Meteor Blitz looks and plays as well as a DS game or PSP Mini.  It has a responsive "twin stick" style, playing much like Super Stardust for PS3, but would also likely please an Age of Zombies fan in terms of feel.  Runs great on Xperia Play, though not optimized.  It would be an even better game if it were!I downloaded it for free with low expectations.  It's a good game.
3	B004KNRWAO	More fun than your basic arcade style spaceship game, the gravity gun feature is unique and it's fun to level up your weapons as you progress through the levels. Too bad the campaign isn't longer or there isn't more to do other than that and survival, but it's entertaining nonetheless
3	B004KNRWAO	This game works great on tmobile g2.  This could have the best touch screen controls I've ever used,  also the graphics are great too.  The developer did a great job.  If you like arcade style games this one is definitely worth the price.
3	B004KNRWAO	A true 5 star app. Crisp graphics, precise controls. Good music and sfx. This isn't even the type of game I normally play,  but I find it great fun. I got it as the FAOTD, but it's well worth the 99c.
2	B004KNRWAO	Not bad for the free ap of the day, but finished it way too quick and the survival mode just isn't keeping my interest.It did shut itself down during game play several times.
3	B004KNRWAO	this is a decent enough game . plays well, adequate graphics. I do not like virtual thumb sticks. filing space.
3	B004KNRWAO	I don't say that lightly... Usually I'm a snob about reviews, but this game has the best controls, the quickest load times, and some positively beautiful graphics. They thought this one through.... Everything from the fact that it automatically pauses when you remove your fingers, to having really nifty upgradeable weapons.The ONLY thing I could possibly find negative about this is that it could have been a little harder... But it was such an enjoyable experience I didn't even think that until after the fact. $0.99 is a steal.
1	B004KNRWAO	downloaded with no issues but game will not open on Acer tablet.  the app opens only to a black screen.
3	B004KNRWAO	"Meteor Blitz" is a very enjoyable game with good graphics and decent controls. This was offered as an Amazon "Free App of the Day", but it is worth the listed price.The interface was fairly easy to learn and I was able to get the hang of it by running through the tutorial. The game is fun, but like most of these types, I am unable to progress as far as my son due to the required hand\eye coordination required.Installed and ran perfectly on my HTC EVO (Android v2.3.3).Recommended!CFH
3	B004KNRWAO	I was pleasantly surprised how good the graphics looked on my Samsung Mesmerize (SGS). The Controls took a moment to get used to, but the tutorial does a good job of walking you through them. Definitely a good game to get.
3	B004KNRWAO	Ran through the Tutorial.  The first time I launched, the game hung.  Had to press Home Button to Exit.  Second Launch, pretty nice.  Couldn't read some of the instructions, because the fixed screen position (horizontal), went over the edge of the playable interface.Otherwise, plays all menu options okay.  Maybe because Thrive is still running on HC 3.1, heard 3.2 may be a bugger, and many devs are waiting for Ice Cream Sandwich for phone/tablet compatible development.Hope the Thrive gets ICS.
3	B004KNRWAO	I got this app a few days ago from Amazon's free app of the day program. I must say it is hands down the best paid app I've gotten from them to date! Beautiful graphics, simple yet addictive gameplay, and a rewarding upgrade system all combine to make this a complete entertainment package. Overall I've had a blast with it and can't wait to finish writing this review so I can get back to playing it.
3	B004KNRWAO	Awsome spin on a classic. Great graphics, smooth gameplay, fun weapons and upgrades. This will keep me entertained for hours.
3	B004KNRWAO	Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6Interestingly, Meteor Blitz is almost 100% exactly like Super Stardust which I play on the PS3.  Did one rip off the other? Dunno, and don't really care.  On with the review.Pretty good!!  The graphics aren't as crisp as I would have liked, a bit fuzzy around the edges.  This is especially the case on my tablet.  The controls worked really well on my phone, but on the tablet, the game had a habit of thinking I'd let go and pause the game.  It's not something I've encountered before with other titles, but after a bit of adjustment, playing with the pads of my thumbs instead of the tips, this mostly disappeared.  Performance on both devices was excellent, not a single slow down or glitch, and no force closes.  The sound effects are good, and the soundtrack just the kind of music I like.  Though the description for Meteor Blitz notes global highscore tracking, I couldn't seem to find it, only the local highscores.  Gameplay is fast paced, with movement near constant, especially as the game progresses.  With several worlds to conquer, and sublevels for each, Meteor Blitz promises a fair amount of game time.  For the $1 they want for it, I'd say it's a fair deal.I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions
3	B004KNRWAO	works on optimus v.  Game is pretty good.  nice. graphics.  reminds of asteroidsfiller,  filler filler,  filler filler,  filler filler,  filler
3	B004KNRWAO	I play this game when i'm "busy". The levels are just long enough to do your duty. Easy to play and cute graphics. You smash and jump over obstacles, thats it. No more, no less.
2	B004KNRWAO	Love the game, but no update in 8 months? Come on, give us some new stuff!!! PLEASE!!! Will rate 5* then.
3	B004KNRWAO	Nice mindless shooter. Well worth the free download. The music is kind of trance like after a few minutes. It's a. Keeper.
3	B004KNRWAO	On my DInc2 the game runs smoothly with no lag at all.On my Iconia A500 the game runs great But the screen is stretched too big cutting off the top part of the screen so you cannot see your score, and lives, and bombs, and etc.A futuristic asteroids style clone done right in my book. Graphics don't make a game great but these graphics are well done with a fast paced game that will keep you alert. Grab this if you haven't already done so!
1	B004KNRWAO	Since one of the FAOTDs hacked my email from somewhere in Ukraine, I can't trust the safety of Amazon apps. It takes only a second to lose your privacy, folks. Not worth it for a game - my privacy is worth more than 99 cents.  SHOW US PERMISSIONS UP FRONT - AMAZON!Edit: One star used only because it's required to post.  App might be great, might not be, but without seeing permission up front a lot of people will not download it.
3	B004KNRWAO	I just put it on today and it is awesome. it is like a modern asteroid game. you fly through space pulverizing asteroids and ships. the music is cool and the graphics. not a bad free game.
3	B004KNRWAO	Most games on Android are not fantastic. This is an exception. It is well programmed, challenging, and a lot of fun. It isn't too repetitive and it is easy to learn. The graphics and sound are above par. Bottom line is that it is a fun game to play. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anybody. And at one dollar, picking this game up should be a no brainer.
2	B004KNRWAO	Everyone I start the game up I am back to world 2 level 4.  But it keeps my high scores from previous games... Fix that and it is an easy 5 star game.
3	B004KNRWAO	Just installed &amp; played the 1st 3 levels. Love it. Controls take some getting used to, but other than that it's freaking sweet. I know there was another review stating that this app forced closed on Incredible, so I was hesitant, but it works just fine on mine.
3	B004KNRWAO	Awesome game.  Unfortunately my mobile gaming comes in 2 minute spurts so it's hard for me to actually enjoy action games. One day I'll find time for it.
3	B004KNRWAO	Love the Comparisons to Asteroids and Super Stardust. This game plays great. It's short but fun. My only problems with it is when you beat the game you don't keep the upgrades and no boss battles. I will be keeping an eye on this developer for future games
2	B004KNRWAO	this is so weird n lame this was also already offered as faotd again there is so much more hotter / way cooler games  out here that should be offered yeah this is some what a fun game but come on
3	B004KNRWAO	Works great on my LG Optimus S with Gingerbread.Fun game too, I like how it handles, that you can shoot in any direction. Nice double stick controls. Nice arcade action.
3	B004KNRWAO	I got this as a free app of the day a while back, and finally got around to reviewing it.  The basic premise is that you have a space ship that is flying around trying to destroy meteors and meteor like objects, in a overhead view.  You have a variety of weapons, bombs, and a booster.  Controls aren't the best, but theyre appropriate for the game.  There are two spots on the touch screen for you to hold with your thumbs and move them around, the left moving your ship, and the right firing and controlling direction of the fire.  On the right there are also spots to switch weapons, boost, and bomb.  The touchscreen factor is what makes them not great, but there's not much you can do about that when touchscreen is your only option.  There are upgrades you can buy to make you better.  There are two modes of play, arcade and survival.  Survival is one level where you just play continuously until you die, whereas arcade has multiple levels and a boss to beat at the end.  Very fun and addictive.  Works well on my Motorola Atrix.
1	B004KNRWAO	I have not been able to play this game yet.  I have installed and reinstalled, but all I get is a black screen when I open the app.  it force closes after about 30-45 seconds.I really wish it would run, all the reviews sound great. : (
3	B004KNRWAO	Smooth game play, quality controls, worth the price if you like shooter games. I hope more great games show up as the daily freebie.
3	B004KNRWAO	Works great so far on honeycomb tablet.  Runs full screen.  Controls work nice on the bigger screen.  Only nit so far is they didn't use the android keyboard, but their own and I found it to not be very responsive when trying to type in my name for high score. :-)  Had to press a button several times to get a letter to appear.
3	B004KNRWAO	it is what it is. follows the usual left stick to move right stick to aim/shoot, graphics are pretty good. Only played a little so far, but I really appreciate that it automatically pauses if both your fingers come off the sticks which is very common, and frustrating when using virtual controls.
3	B004KNRWAO	seriously people learn how to rate an app. if it doesn't open on your device don't rate it low.  rate the app itself and the way it is.  ratings should be based on the Apps performance.
3	B004KNRWAO	I got this for free and give it and love it as I was a huge fan of SSDHD. Everything is just like it, but more stages and a couple of welcome additions. Five Stars because it's a pretty stellar port of an amazing game, but I wouldn't be surprised if they get sued into oblivion.
3	B004KNRWAO	This game is super fast and great action.Never lags.  only wish it was longer or they would come up with part two.
2	B004KNRWAO	The game plays super smooth, and I love that it pauses if you lift your fingers. Controls are very accurate and responsive. One big issue for me is that it won't save progress. Every time I go to play it resets high scores and I'm on level 1 at the tutorial. I played till the third level and still not unlocked to continue.
2	B004KNRWAO	I was really liking this game. It's quite lot of fun, and deceptively simple. But after playing for a while, and getting almost all upgrades, i pressed quit to exit the game, instead of just pressing home. Now I can only pick which level to go to, but have to start with no upgrades. That's really stupid, dev.
3	B004KNRWAO	Great pretty colorful vibrant update on an old classic genre. On the DroidX it pauses every time you let go of controls. I'm not sure if that's normal or not but it makes gameplay weird.
2	B004KNRWAO	Nice graphics, super responsive/smooth gameplay. I noticed a couple of buggy things. The game seemed to repetitively pause itself, then ask u to touch the screen to resume play. The pause button is in the top right corner, I never touched it. So that was weird. Occasionally, the screen would go black for a second or two. Other than that, the gameplay was flawless. As for the game itself, its really repetetive...but still a nice little time waster. Check it out for urself!
2	B004KNRWAO	This is a beautiful and fun game with lots of variety and levels of nicely increasing difficulty. It puts Sinister Planet to shame visually, in terms of gameplay, and in terms of controls, while at the same time training you a bit to operate Sinister Planet in the difficult turret mode, where your ship and your turret move independently. And the movement and controls are a lot less frustrating than Sinister Planet. But the thing about Sinister Planet is that it is so hard that you can't beat it and will keep playing it. It takes a long time to get good too. This game on the other hand can be beaten in a few hours. If this game could be made more difficult and/or have more levels, it would be a keeper. As it stands though, it's kind of a beautiful throwaway without much replayability. I'd be interested in the developer's next project, hopefully a fuller one.
2	B004KNRWAO	Nice graphics, game play, helpful instructions and tutorial, etc. Fun to play overall, and it's free (thanks Amazon). The single downside is a big one, however, it crashed my phone.  :-(
1	B004KNRWAO	No other complaints than the controls freeze on my atrix.  Game would be great if that were fixed but until then it's unplayable and not even worth the purchase.  Glad I got it for the free app of the day promotion.
3	B004KNRWAO	This is a beautiful, challenging, &amp; very enjoyable game. its like a kick ass Android version of an old, old arcade favorite: Asteroids.I usually can't stand on screen controls, but these work really well, even when your thumbs drift a but in the excitement.HTC Incredible
3	B004KNRWAO	Very nice graphics and priced just right, it will be a keeper. Keep up the good work, hope to see more apps from you. Thanks Amazon!
3	B004KNRWAO	Of the dozens of games I've installed on my droid x this is my absolute favorite. The controls are perfect and responsive! I never cease to be amazed at the level of intensity that this that this game manages to maintain. After hours and hours of play my thumbs are sore but I still want more!
2	B004KNRWAO	Too much no action time.  Nice graphically  and nice for an app this size it can go on the SD card.
3	B004KNRWAO	I can see myself playing this game frequently not just one time and the uninstall. The controls are fluid and easy to use. The graphics are great.
3	B004KNRWAO	Reminds me of Pew Pew.  This is a very well developed and smooth running game. Great graphics and gameplay.  It is Atari Asteroids on major steroids!
3	B004KNRWAO	I love the Free App of the Day promotion.I just downloaded the Meteor Blitz app.  This is nice game.  The Graphics look very good on my Samsung Vibrant and kind of make me wish I had a larger screen.  This is a shooter game with the controls on screen in the lower left and right corners.  Left thumb to move the ship and right thumb to shoot and change weapons.The nice this is that it comes w/ a good tutorial when you first start playing the game to show you how to use your ship.  I recommend this as one of the better games on android right now.  This is a good little time waster.
3	B004KNRWAO	I love this game. I had it on my Ipod Touch and have been looking for other for my Samsung Droid Charge. Ever since i have gotten this phone. Controls are great works as well as the version from my ipod touch. slight difference in colors. The colors are brighter on my phone. Great Free App! Thxs Amazon!
3	B004KNRWAO	Meteor Blitz is the best space shooter I have played hands down. I wish the was a bit more diversity in the genre but eh... I got it for free. Definitely worth the price though having played its competition.
1	B004KNRWAO	starts up to a black screen on my galaxy tab 10.1, so this app is unplayable for me. too bad, the other reviews look OK.
1	B004KO3H8E	It only let me listen to samples. I really wanted to enjoy this. Too bad. I wanted to listen to Tarzan.
3	B004KO3H8E	I love audio books at bed time. I do wish this had a few more titles in the mystery sectioin.
2	B004KO3H8E	I love audio books but (for the most part) only if they are not through Amazon and only if they are free.In this case I was looking for an app which would allow books to be quickly downloaded but also was hoping for a smooth transition (like what I get from my local library when I download books) from chapter to chapter.Unfortunately this program does not do that.The audio books are wonderful (so far) but:1) Even when a chapter has finished playing, it doesn't continue on to the next chapter (even when those chapters have already been downloaded).2) The chapters play immediately after being downloaded (a pain when you just want to download a few).3) Getting out of it smoothly almost never happens.All in all, were the app not free, I probably would not use it but I think if they could make the software run without so many hassles, it would help.
1	B004KO3H8E	man i did not like this app did not give u a search tab these books i never even heard of its a waste of time seriously donor download this app
2	B004KO3H8E	Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6I've been into audiobooks for years, having a long daily drive to and from work.  Getting audiobooks has certainly helped me get some daily literary time in.  Normally, I pick up titles from Audible, having a Gold account there that runs $15/mo, or one "free" book each month.  It's great and all, but, there are a load of classic titles that I've never read.  Enter this app, which contains a number of classics and other free domain titles.  Excellent!  Now I have more to listen to, and I can catch up on the classics.The app itself isn't bad, but it's not all that great either.  A lot of this comparison is coming from my experience with Audible's app, which I've been used both on Android and iOS.  Some of it from comparison to Audiobooks by Traveling Classics, which offers up a over 3500 of the LibriVox audiobooks.  According to Jagamaga, the value they've added is that the tracks have been cleaned up and come in the M4A format.  At current, there are around 80 titles in this free version, while the Jagamaga's premium version overs 180.  That's a pretty far cry from Audiobook's collection.Titles are downloaded to the SD card of your device, which is good because even though they are compressed, they can take up some serious space.  The tracks themselves have no ID3 tagging information in them, so you may want to use an editor to add that stuff in.  While you download, you can't jump over to another title and have it download that too.  You're stuck there waiting for it to finish downloading before you can do anything else, you can't even back out.  Using the home button will get you out and the download will continue, but you can't go back in and browse other titles or queue up more downloads.  All downloads are dropped into sub folders for each title, nicely organized.  Jagamaga doesn't keep track of your library of stuff you've downloaded, but at least offers the ability to continue listening to the previous book you were enjoying, and even picks up right where you left off.  That alone is one place it excels over Audiobooks.  The recordings themselves are pretty decent.  The narrators aren't pros, but do a decent job.Given the state of the app, I think I'll be downloading and using a different media player instead of the one Jamamaga includes. It simply isn't versatile enough to get them job done.  And the premium version?  Frankly, I didn't see...errrr....hear any reason why I would want to pay for them instead of getting them for free via Audiobooks.
3	B004KO3H8E	This app introduced me to librivox.org, and though the app itself says that there is a full Jagamaga Audiobooks available for purchase, I wasn't able to find it. In any case, great app for listening on the go.
3	B004KO3H8E	love this app. PRICE was right. could use lots of tweeking for a paid version BUT love this app cause we can listen to lots of good classics. thank you!
2	B004KO3H8E	It seems to work great.  Unfortunately, there isn't much of a selection of books that I would like to read or hear.
2	B004KO3H8E	I was disappointed to find out that my Kindle Fire did not come with the text-to-speech capability available on earlier Kindles. as a result, I was stuck with audio books, some of which are quite expensive. I was actually searching for an App to give the Fire text-to-speech when I happened on Jagamaga Free. The App itself downloaded and installed easily but there are no documents. The only instruction said selected audio books would be downloaded to a file called Jagamaga on the device's SD card. When I clicked on the App it would show only the last book I downloaded and I couldn't figure out where to find the other books I had downloaded. Finally, I called went online to Kindle support and the technician duplicated what I had done and found the files in the music gallery because the books are downloaded as MP3 files.Jagamaga makes about half of its library available through the free app and the entire library for the paid App which, on Amazon is only $0.99. Unfortuantely, the paid App apparently is not compatible with the Kindle Fire(according to Amazon) though I can't understand why since it only removes the restriction to full library access.Still, there's some pretty good stuff available on Jagamaga Free for free. The voices are done by volunteers and so far, all I have heard are female voices. I played Mark Twain's "Ghost Story" and Rudyard Kipling's "My Personal Ghost" and both voices were female reading a man's character. But then, my momma read to me when I was small so I didn't have a lot of trouble adjusting.The player is simple to operate and downloads are quick and easy. Sounds (voices) are clear and sharp. I would have no hesitation in purchasing the pay version of this App if it worked on my Kindle Fire. It's a great way to get classic writings at a perfect price -- free.Had this App given me access to the entire library, I would rated it with four stars.
3	B004KO3H8E	Nice selection of books, organized well.  Free is always nice. Easy to use.  I would enjoy a variety of voices reading the books, male and female.  The female voice reading these books is not my favorite.
1	B004KO3H8E	I'm not real pleased with this app.  It freezes my Kindle up all the time which is very annoying. I wouldn't purchase it again.
3	B004KO3H8E	Jagamaga works fine with Fire with a little ingenuity. To access the Jaga audiofiles you just need to also get the free app File manager for Fire. Using the file manager you just look in the files for the clearly named Jagamaga file and click that and there you are. The Jaga books are great and free. Currently the Premium[99cents] Jagamaga is not functional at all on Kindle, so just enjoy the free audio books site.
3	B004KO3H8E	This is the first and only audio book app I've ever used.  I love it so far.  Books such as The Secret Garden and Sherlock Holmes, I've been meaning to read, but haven't found the time.  The readers are volunteers, and do a wonderful job bringing the stories to life.  Can't wait for more books to be available.One downside..Nowhere can I find the books I've downloaded.  I have to search through the list of available books and try to remember what's been downloaded.  And, if for some reason I leave the book midway, (such as a forced close which occasionally happens) you have to scan every chapter to find your spot.  All in all, a very good app for free!
1	B004KO3H8E	I did not care for this app much unlessyou are into the old-school literaturewith not much choice. I think that muchimprovement is needed here with thisapp. With some thought and some morework this could be a good one. Can Irecommend it? Not so much now!
2	B004KO3H8E	I want to buy this app but I don't know if the book I'm reading is on there. can someone with this app look up the book called the upstairs floor so I don't buy this app and not have my book on there.
3	B004KO3H8E	It must be the best audiobook I have ever had for my phone. I love it and would suggest it to everyone.
3	B004KO3H8E	It's free and it allows me to take books wherever I go. Also the abundance of the free audiobooks they have to offer is amazing. Why pay when you can get it free. And we all like free.
3	B004KO3H8E	Don't listen to the negative reviews on this app. As a college student, I have many books assigned and I do not have the time to read them all. With this app I have been able to make it through several assigned classics in a short period of time. It's a wonderful app and the voices are great. I plan to buy the full version when made available for the kindle fire.
1	B004KO3H8E	I'm not trying to be offensives to anyone, (I have seen Mexicans get stooped by a cop for driving a lawnmower in the street).  this app is useless.  u can read off the list of authors in ten minutes.  out of the millions of people who write books, they choose about .0001% of that.  I might be going easy on the app by saying that percentage.  its kinda poor.  I'm sorry but JAGAMAGA needs to do a better job at this app and any other app that the may intend to create.  if you've ever heard of audiobooks.com its much better.  although you have to pay for the book it is worth the money if you are having trouble reading words.&quot;the price is rediculous.  a $10 book cost $28 in an audio form.  if you don't have any problem reading I do not reccomend this at all what so ever.
1	B004KS886G	tried the app for a few minutes. to be honest, i dint find it very accurate in differentiating between truth and lie. so uninstalled.
3	B004KS886G	You need to go back to school and learn how to spell and use grammar correctly. Please don't post anymor./ This app is awesome people need to look up more info to find out more about this app and how to use it! :D
3	B004KS886G	Its fun to play around with but no matter how hard I try I can't get it to peg me as a liar lqtm
3	B004KS886G	5/5 because it does exactly what the Dev says it does. It analyses stress levels in someone's voice. You have to let them know you're using it. If someone thinks there's increase chance of being caught in a lie, their voice and ability to lie convincingly is compromised.With the right subject and questioning technique, you will nail them in the lies.
3	B004KS886G	I used this on a naughty kid one day. He swears I am a detective now. But he told the truth teeheehee
1	B004KS886G	says my voice is stressed when I just say &quot;hello&quot; don't see how this could possible work.  wasted my time. uninstall.
1	B004KS886G	The app itself was good.  Used similar programs previously.  I uninstalled the app due to display issues.  Would consider future instilation if issues are corrected.
1	B004KS886G	I downloaded this app, and then went to Cambridge to ask that retired "Lucasian Professor" Hawking about his crazy ideas about blackhole radiation and the Earth being older than 6000 years.  This thing did not register that he was lying through his teeth.  Total disappointment.
1	B004KS886G	Loads and then crashes whenever I try to get the usage hint to go off screen.  My rating is based on the crashing.
1	B004KS886G	This app has nothing to do with lie detection, you're better off learning the eye movement triggers if you want to test for lying...
2	B004KS886G	Just okay! nothing special here! And not what I thought it would be or as good as I thought it would be!
3	B004KS886G	To the moron who teaches college level electronics, you think that makes you intelligent? I took college level computer tech, teacher was a fumbling idiot, who knew far less than the students. Do you teach proper technique on polygraph? Yeah didn't think so. Just because your skill is lacking, doesn't. mean this is a 1 star app.
1	B004KS886G	It seems to be based not necessarily on the volume of speech, but rather on sudden changes in the volume of speech.  That being said, even if it could determine stress in speaking, the display and controls would still make it useless.  It doesn't give an overall score, it just marks parts of the waveform in red.  1: it's not real-time. 2: the playback controls are poor, you can't skip to the parts it "thinks" someone is lying  3: after a second of silence it stops, and there's no way to save results for later, so if the test subject pauses to take a breath, the program will automatically stop and you either have to a: record over what you just recorded without seeing the result, or b: you then have to send him out of the room so you can listen to the playback to see what is marked as being a lie before resetting the program and continuing to record.In summary: it's barely worth the price of free.
1	B004KS886G	i tested it...  my words were these...  &quot;i went to see santa yesterday, he gave me the keys to his sled &quot; the analysis  said..  &quot;probably truth.&quot;i inagine it would make for a great parenting tool or party joke..  but it does not obviously produce real results.
1	B004KS886G	I am having the same issues with crashing as some others. I am using a Thrive. I am giving it one star because I have to give it something and I didn't get to try it out completely. I hope the developers can make it compatible with the Thrive and I would be willing to try it out again.
1	B004KS886G	Another time waster. I wasn't expecting it to work but this literally didn't work. I just had an &#34;empty&#34; app. It was stupid so I deleted it.
3	B004KS886G	If you are trying to rely on this to find out whether or not someone is lying to you, don't put a whole lot of faith in it.  It's really to be used more for entertainment purposes and anyone who thinks that it's accurate enough to be used as proof against someone really needs to re-think their methods.It's a good tool to use against kids because they don't really know if it works or not.  They are more likely to tell the truth if they think a machine can tell you they are lying.
1	B004KS886G	I had to uninstall because it wont record any sound and gets stuck on the record part and freezes and all I can do is force close it. Wouldn't recommend it to any other Samsung Galaxy S users.
1	B004KS886G	really? thats the biggest spam review I have ever seen in my life. this app ain't based on anything at all. but you are right your Samsung phone is junk. but all you are doing is setting people up so when this fake app don't work someone can say oh It's your junk phone
1	B004KS886G	Every time I open it there is a message that won't close then the whole app crashes.  Waste of time.
1	B004KS886G	This app is worse than useless at detecting lies.  Guessing is more accurate.  Even if the claimed implementation of the algorithm was correctly done it still can't differentiate between a truthful response, an irritated response, an angry one, or an untruthful one.
3	B004KSA7G0	Great reference when you just want to send your sweetie a little sweet text or note to just let them know you love them and are thinking of them!
3	B004KSA7G0	If you can't think of things to say on your own then this app is for you. Helps you express feeling for your beloved or for yourself.
1	B004KSA7G0	really people use sayings that come from ur heart I mean ur not really gonna take advice from this don't use this app its pathetic say things from ur heart not from this stupid apps I'm not afraid to say that I am a hater. I would rate it no stars if I could
2	B004KSA7G0	I was hoping to find some material in here to help write cards, love notes or even my wedding vows... I found that it was too many quotes and not very organized
1	B004KSA7G0	I didn't care for this app.I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it.Currently looking for another to take it's place.
2	B004KSA7G0	This app is ok but the quotes are not neat and some are just vary corny.If you are looking for something fast and free the I say go for it but if you are looking for something sepechele then you better keep looking.
3	B004KSA7G0	this app is filled with nothing but beautiful words,romantic quotes,and advise about carrying on after a major loss. I cried with almost every word,I truly recommend this for everyone! you never know,you might even learn something! &lt;3
3	B004KSA7G0	this is awesome, my grandchild rated this game a 10. ten being good. so she recommend this game to all ages.
1	B004KSA7G0	This app is not as unique that I was hoping it would be. It seems more like Valentine's cards than any other varied ways to express feelings.
1	B004KSA7G0	I did not like this app at all.  It was not what I expected and I deleted it shortly after downloading.
2	B004KSA7G0	These quotes were not bad at all.  I just found myself getting bored with it.  There is only so many of these you can share.
3	B004KSA7G0	I Use this app on my tablet to remind me of the many ways I can see my love and just how much I need to appreciate all she is and does each and every day.  Some times I get so busy that I forget to think of her and these quotes help me to see her in a refreshing light as the authors experienced in their own lives. Inspiring and challenging this app is great
1	B004KSA7G0	It's good for Valentine's Day or if you need something for a special occasion, but other than that I haven't really used it.
3	B004KSA7G0	I like this app because it gives u really good quotes. its just the ads. they drive me nuts! rather than tht I luv this app!
3	B004KSAIPA	Simple, clean design, fun, easy to use, hard enough to hold interest but not so tough that it is frustrating. Good value overall.
2	B004KSAIPA	I feel like you can only do this puzzle if you can keep up with the news no matter if you're at home or anywhere else.
3	B004KSAIPA	These crossword puzzle are easy enough anyone can do. Love it! I was never good at crosswords but with this one I don't feel so dumb.
3	B004KSAIPA	Beware american people. Some of the spelling will be different, not wrong just not what you're used to. You can do it!
3	B004KSAIPA	Addictive!  Really enjoy the app.  Good questions and I like letter vs whole word hints as well.  Puzzles are short and quick.
3	B004KSAIPA	Like that you can check answers without revealing any letters, or words if you don't want.  pretty easy, but with some surprises!
3	B004KSAIPA	makes my ride to work fun...would like to not re-use the same words so much bur all together its a great game
3	B004KSAIPA	The fact that I can do crosswords without killing a tree is great. Just wish that there were a few longer puzzles.
3	B004KSAIPA	I wasn't expecting very much from this game because my experience with app games is that they get boring after a short period of time.  This one kept my interest for quite a long time and I had to finally pull myself away from it.  Highly recommended.
3	B004KSAIPA	If you are a crosswords fan you will enjoy this app. The puzzles are not extremely difficult,but challenging enough to keep you engaged. For those who are new to crossword puzzles,the hints or answers would be a great helpLove the App
2	B004KSAIPA	I used this ap for a few days and then took it off my kindle. I just wasn't impressed with the game.
3	B004KSAIPA	fun game to play, I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys crossword puzzles. Lots of fun,  a good time!
3	B004KSAIPA	like the product for my samsung galaxy 2 and kindle fire. lots of puzzles available and they are challenging for my rabid crossword needs. easy to use
1	B004KSAIPA	I like crosswords but this one is BORING. I bought it when it was free and hated it. not worth 1.99 at all.
3	B004KSAIPA	Fast and easy to play because of great graphics. I love letter mistakes shown, it helps because I know some answers, but misspell.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a British game.  It's not incredibly hard, but it provides an extra challenge.  Totally worth 99&cent;.  I recommend it.
3	B004KSAIPA	Nice cross word with easy to fill grid and choice of easy to hard puzzles. Offer plenty of puzzles too. Also has hints either by letter to word or entire puzzle.
3	B004KSAIPA	TONS of puzzles!!  -- 200!!!  I love the clue view.  But everything about this app works for me.  You can start a puzzle, leave it do another come back to.,etc.  And even when you finish a puzzle you fan clear it and do it again later!!  limitless!
3	B004KSAIPA	addicting and fun. hours of fun and cheaper than a crossword book! try the free version and I guarantee you'll get addicted! 1.99 is the perfect price!
3	B004KSAIPA	Lots of fun and easy to play. Use your finger instead of a pen and there are hints to help you along.
3	B004KSAIPA	I got the free version of this app and tried it. I was never into crossword puzzles, but I wasn't able to stop doing them! So when I finished with the all the free puzzles, I got the paid version. Greatest investment I ever made. Recently however, it's been saying that the crosswords I have already finished aren't finished. But other than that, great app!
3	B004KSAIPA	Love playing this crossword game. The clues are hard enough to the game interesting. Well worth the price. Hours of fun can be had with this game.
3	B004KSAIPA	I love crossword puzzles and this app is the best.  The puzzles are challenging but not too difficult.  They are just right.  I like that you get many many crosswords to do for 99 cents.  What a great deal!
3	B004KSAIPA	Mostly good. Really not bad. Just kinda okay. Works to kill time. Decent distraction. Like it enough to keep it on my phone. Basically not junk.
3	B004KSAIPA	This crossword game is entertaining and challenging.  It's easy to check your words and a great way to improve your spelling and vocabulary.
3	B004KSAIPA	this app is fantastic ..has medium skill puzzles..I really like the answer checker..if you like crossword's you NEED to get this!!!!!
2	B004KSAIPA	Good to pass the time but not what I'm used to in the newspapers. Still ok to keep your mind sharp.
3	B004KSAIPA	I AM ENJOYING THE PUZZLES, THOUGH THE ALLEGORICAL REFERENCE'S SEEM TO BE OBTUSE, IT JUST MAKES SOLVING THAT MUCH MORE SATISFYING.
3	B004KSAIPA	Very good game. Keeps you occupied for hours. Easy to use. This game is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it!
3	B004KSAIPA	Really good app, worth the 99c. Only problem is that they use some British slang/British spelling for some of the clues/answers, so that can be a bit confusing for some people. But it's not a horrible thing wrong and since I know a lot of that kind of slang and spelling anyway it doesn't bother me, lol.
2	B004KSAIPA	This a fun way to do crosswords without sharpening pencils and blowing eraser debris all over. Just tap away, get hints, write over mistakes. So far the puzzles seem "medium" skill level.What I don't like are the puzzle grids themselves. They interlock but they aren't the same as the newspaper grids that build words in blocks.
3	B004KSAIPA	I don't normally buy programs that don't have a box, but I bought this one.  I found myself playing it enough to make it worthwhile.
2	B004KSAIPA	It's a hard game for kid's but the older you get the easier it is for you.I'm guessing ten and up is a good. age.
3	B004KSAIPA	It is a good app. Keeps you busy and I like the fact that you can get clues or have it tell you the full answer. I think its pretty good for the price as well.
3	B004KSAIPA	Not the easiast puzzles, but easy enough that I can get most of the answers - at least on level 1, but then I always went for the easy crossword books in the past. I like the  way you can choose help by either a letter at a time or fill in the whole word which I may need a lot more if the puzzles get progressively harder!
3	B004KSAIPA	I love this app ! It keeps me entertained for hours. I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends. Worth every penny.
3	B004KSAIPA	Love this.  For the price, you get many hours of fun.  Love the helpful hints when i misspell a word.
3	B004KSAIPA	semi -mindless fun. not your new York times puzzles, but a great way to pass the time. recommended for the
3	B004KSAIPA	These are good puzzles with the right mix of semi-hard and easily solved clues all within the same puzzle.  You get a lot of puzzles for the money.  A very good deal.
3	B004KSAIPA	I agree with a previous review that is a fun game that can be enjoyed with no stress.  Enjoy yourself.
3	B004KSAIPA	I'M NOT GREAT AT SOLVING CROSSWORDS. WITH THE HINTS IT MAKES IT EASIER TO SOLVE.  LOTS OF PUZZLES. EASY TO NAVIGATE. I LIKE THIS ONE A LOT.
3	B004KSAIPA	Thoroughly enjoyable crossword game. I really liked the clue list view with boxes to enter your answer, combined with the separate crossword grid view to check out your progress. I hope by the time I've completed the six puzzle packs that there are additional packs available for purchase.
3	B004KSAIPA	I've only done two puzzles so far, but I'm having a good time working them out. No glitches so far. The directions are good from the get go. Caution, the app does tend toward British clues &amp; answers. The publishers recommend non-anglophiles go with Crossword (US). Great app!
3	B004KSAIPA	fun &amp; challenging game. im not very good  at crossword puzzles. so having the cheats is a huge help. not to mention that the clues... the ones I can figure out...are not as tough as I thought they would be.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great game. The puzzles are entertaining and pretty easy to solve. And even if you make a mistake, it's easy to fix the problem.
3	B004KSAIPA	I love crossword puzzles.  the nice thing about these puzzles is that they are challenging but still solvable.  I would purchase more of these puzzles.
2	B004KSAIPA	This crossword is good but not the best.  Too many UK references.  Too many hanging letters which are not included in words..  Crosswords seem too sparse.
3	B004KSAIPA	Probably one of the better crossword apps I've seen. Not too ridiculously easy, nor is it too ridiculously difficult. And certainly enough puzzles to last a while!
3	B004KSAIPA	It keeps my brains working.  Have fun playing with my son.  He give me the answers I don't know.  Thanks!
3	B004KSAIPA	Nice crossword app but probably made for Brits.  Very enjoyable though so after trying the free version, I bought this one.
3	B004KSAIPA	I love this Crossword app. There are so many crosswords and they are a lot of fun. I love the option to reveal a letter or a word, if you need to, and to check your answers. The lite version was cool, but it's more than worth it to buy the app.
3	B004KSAIPA	So, how could a crossword app be "great" but have limitations? Well, the puzzles are not entirely like newspaper crosswords since there are fewer words than newspapers. With fewer words horizontally and vertically, there's a gap in the letters that you'll have to get the words. In other words, a word may have 8 letters, but you only get one or two letters that cross that word. On the other hand, I do love the way the color of the square goes from yellow to blue when you get a correct letter. But, then, it's sometimes difficult to fill in a blank without the cursor moving to the next available letter. These can be tweaked by the user. All and all, an enjoyable app with a fair amount of puzzles to while away the hours.
3	B004KSAIPA	Challenging enough to keep you on your toes.  I could sure use a "hint" feature.  I haven't done crossword puzzles for the past 30 years so when I get stuck, I'm really stuck.  I just play SUDOKO or some other game until I get home and do google searches.
3	B004KSAIPA	I checked out the &quot;lite&quot; version for my Kindle Fire and after completing all of them, I felt compelled to upgrade! This game offers a nice middle ground as far as the difficulty goes and the interface is easy to use.
3	B004KSAIPA	A relaxing bedtime app ... and good for stimulating one's brain power.  If you enjoy words, you'll enjoy this app.  I did!
3	B004KSAIPA	I enjoyed doing puzzles.  After a few games, I looked up who wrote them because some of the clues were odd to me.
3	B004KSAIPA	Paid money for the app because I didn't feel like just the free stuff.  Wasn't much and love having all the puzzles to go back to when I get to play.  Easy to use and cheats are available but the cool thing are the options for hints.  If you are really stuck you can select for the first letter to be revealed, you can choose for a few letters, or you can choose the whole word.  You can check all of your answers at anytime if you get caught - especially handy when things aren't matching up - mistakes will be highlighted so you know where to go to start rethinking an answer for correction.
3	B004KSAIPA	The Crossword app comes with 200 crosswords.  Yes, that's right...TWO HUNDRED CROSSWORDS.  The app makes working crosswords easy.  When the board is displayed, the currently highlighted clue appears above the board.  To change a clue, just touch somewhere on the board.  The entire clue list is also available.The app has options to reveal answers or check answers and tell you what is right/wrong.What really stood out was just how intuitive the app is and how fast clues can be solved.  The app is well-designed and works flawlessly.200 crosswords for 2 bucks.  That's a deal of a lifetime.
3	B004KSAIPA	so far-so good. Puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. Looking forward to having a game that keeps my mind agile.
3	B004KSAIPA	TOTALLY LOVE IT. IT IS A FUN WAY TO PASS THE TIME AWSOME. puzzle are my favorite pastime cool.stretches the old noggin cells
3	B004KSAIPA	I have really enjoyed this app since I have been spending a lot of time with some health issues and dr's appointments and it really helps pass the time. Plus they are great puzzles.
3	B004KSAIPA	It plays beautifully on my new tablet that I got for Christmas.  I'm having TONS of fun with it.  You'll love it too.
3	B004KSAIPA	I tore through the free trial and didn't hesitate to buy the full version. It is challenging enough to be interesting but easy enough to do in the in between times when you are waiting for practice to let out or an order to be filled.
3	B004KSAIPA	If you like crosswords you will like this. Not too hard but mildly challenging. Love the British words that are unfamiliar to me. This adds a little spice to the game. Easy to use.  A good way to pass time and keep the brain cells sharp.
3	B004KSAIPA	Four stars awarded, rather than five because some of the terms were just a tad bit dated for even myself. who enjoys a good word-based brain teaser with literary form and eloquence.  In all honesty, I would have given the app 4.5 stars rather than 4.0 stars as the app is truly worth its price and is of considerable quality.. with the added bonus of error check, letter/word reveal, as well as other handy tools available, this crossword app is truly a a WI_ N_R!!! ;)
2	B004KSAIPA	There are lots of puzzles to work for the price but the way they are constructed is not like traditional crossword puzzles. The navigational tools are simple and easy to use. Overall, a good way to pass the time while traveling or in a waiting room.
2	B004KSAIPA	Good puzzles and user friendly. The difficulty is about average I would say. I do wish there were more columns used in some puzzles though, patterned like the NY Times puzzles. Most of the words in the puzzles only have 2 or 3 words crossing them leaving many black non-used squares. Other than that it is still fun and challenging.
3	B004KSAIPA	Great game!  A little more difficult than my paperback puzzles, but I like that it makes me think!  If you like crosswords, you will like this game.
2	B004KSAIPA	Interesting but if you don't playing every day, you lose your progress and have to start all over again. Don't like that much at all. Was away from Kindle for a day or two and was forced to start over. Was not a happy camper. Haven' t picked it up again since. Just be forewarned
3	B004KSAIPA	While some of the terms and occasional spelling is different that in the US, I truly love this app. It varies in difficuly from puzzle to puzzle and there is about a year's worth of puzzles in the app. It is definitely worth every cent...or pound. LOL
3	B004KSAIPA	This a very fun and stimulating game. I use it to help my vocabulary. I have learned several new words.
3	B004KSAIPA	I gave the crossword puzzle a five star because I really enjoy working it.  It is quite a challenge.  Janet
3	B004KSAIPA	Good way to pass the time. Easy to do. If you are an expert crossworder, this might be too easy for you.
3	B004KSAIPA	This app is the best way to pass some time! Engrossing, and in no time you'll wonder where the time went.
3	B004KSAIPA	I like crossword puzzles. The British style is a little more difficult and some of the words are a dialect I'm not familiar with. I think I'll choose American style next time.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is the best crossword app for Android.  Users click a blank and it displays the clue for the highlighted word.  You can also select a more traditional view with the entire clue list on the side and puzzle next to it.The puzzles are not easy but they are not hard either. There is even a crossword puzzle guide included that explains different clues and keyword meanings which is good for all crossword fans.The author is definitely a Brit so some of the words and clues may be a little quirky or unfamiliar, but that will just help expand your vocabulary and stretch you mind.  Isn't that part of why we love crosswords anyway?  Great app overall!
3	B004KSAIPA	As far as crosswords go I think it could be set up a little different.  I still like it but don't play it near as much as I thought I would.
3	B004KSAIPA	For $0.99, this is worth every penny. I have been waiting for a good crossword puzzle app for a while. Its input method is excellent. I never felt limited by a cellphone screen mixed with touchscreen using this.The only downside (for some) is that this app is VERY clearly British and it asks a lot of questions that non-Brits will probably not know. For example, it asks things such as who won the World Cup in 2007, the owner of Harrods and British actors. I'm sure these are as common-knowledge as knowing who won the Superbowl or knowing where the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is for them. The good news is that you can choose to reveal a letter or word, so if you ever get stuck on something, you won't have an incomplete puzzle.Well done with this game! Despite being a dumb American, I'm having a fun time playing with it. :)
3	B004KSAIPA	This app comes with enough crosswords to keep you occupied for quite a while. Clues are displayed clearly and are not too hard to figure out. The spellings are British though, so keep that in mind. Entering the letters is very easy. I'm using a Kindle Fire. All in all, a great app for crossword lovers.
3	B004KSAIPA	Quality crossword app...not to the level of NY Times crosswords, but decent grids to solve. I haven't found them to be ridiculously easy (admittedly, i would love them to be harder, but they aren't so elementary as not to bother) or overly British, as some reviewers had stated.  They are good puzzles, formatting is easy to use, and enjoyable pasttime. For free, I say give them a go!
1	B004KSAIPA	I didn't care for this at all, too many blank spaces makes it not quite like a good old traditional crossword puzzle.
3	B004KSAIPA	Bought this on a whim and happy I did so. If you love crossword puzzles then this is the app for you at a great price!
3	B004KSAIPA	I love doing crossword puzzles and these are great I would recommend this app for anyone who lies doing crosswords
3	B004KSAIPA	nice variety of puzzles. not too easy nor too hard. good range of knowledge will have you solvingthese in good time.
3	B004KSAIPA	Very easy interface.  Puzzles are challenging enough to keep me interested.  It's easily worth the money.  My daughter is actually working the puzzles to expand her vocabulary!  I really like the ability to change the settings from grid to individual clues.  Great game!
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great product.  Really makes you use your brain.  I have had other software crosswords for computer, but this one has them all beat.Easy to use, and entertaining too!
3	B004KSAIPA	I bought the full version of the game and it's great. You get 100s of puzzles for way less than buying a book at the store. The settings are very helpful as well.
3	B004KSAIPA	very entertaining ap.  I have always loved crosswords and this is a new and easier way to play.  Easy to navigate, no lags or bugs so far.
3	B004KSAIPA	I chose this app because I saw reviews that stated that the crosswords in this app used British spelling (which is what we use in my country).
1	B004KSAIPA	I've deleted this crossword game. Too annoying to keep switching back and forth between game and list of clues. The crossword game at pogo.com is much easier to use.
3	B004KSAIPA	I have really enjoyed playing this game.  It is easy to use and challenging but not impossible to win.  The game has worked well for me.
3	B004KSAIPA	wonderful puzzles. you get so many for the cost!  thank you. puzzles need more words in them though. where will I get more puzzles once ive finished these?!
2	B004KSAIPA	I wasn't happy with this crossword presentation. There is too little information in clues given, and no way to get answers for comparison when puzzles have been completed. I wouldn't recommend this selection for purchase. Also, this is a United Kingdom written puzzle. If you're not familiar with some of the UK use of words and phrases, some of these puzzles can't be completed.
3	B004KSAIPA	believe it or not I recently just starting doing crossword puzzles and now I am so addicted :) I love it &amp; will continue.  thanks teazel
3	B004KSAIPA	The important thing in an electronic crossword game to me is the ease of filling in, checking answers and getting hints. This game is okay at that but you have to navigate through a couple of buttons to get to looking at a clue. That is frustrating.The rest of the game is great. Clear display, no funky fonts, fill-in is easy on the Kindle with the pop up keyboard.There are 5 sets of 50 puzzles so there is a lot packed into one little app.When you are done and the puzzle is correct, it tells you "Congratulations" but it still requires two back buttons to get to start a new puzzle. When you finish a puzzle it should take you back to the menu.It should be noted that some of the clues and answers are more in the line of Australian terminology. It doesn't get in the way often but some spelling is different and some answers are not typical American words.A recommended app for puzzler fans.
3	B004KSAIPA	Best I've seen in quite a while. Most outstanding crossword game. Many very good questions/clues. Well done.  (dewliner36)  Keep it up.Outstanding.
3	B004KSAIPA	I love this app. It is very entertaining not too hard but I learn something new with each game. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars, is because I lost call my games that I competed when I changed my kindle and had to start back from game 1.
3	B004KSAIPA	I think the interface is very intuitive and easy to use. I love how I can choose any of the 300 puzzles without having to solve the previous and I can start a few simultaneously. If you hit the back button, your spot gets saved. This app is perfect on my Note 2. Well worth the $2 for lots of puzzles to do while having my morning, midday, or nightly coffee!
2	B004KSAIPA	I found some of this game to be challenging and it makes you think.  I like the cheat factor and the game works well but I found when you have completed the puzzle you have to click on reveal the whole puzzle or it won't show it as complete.
3	B004KSAIPA	Very good crossword app.  I am not good at crosswords but have been able to solve most of the words I got stuck on by using the show a letter hint.  The words are common enough that I know what they are.  Would recommend this app.
3	B004KSAIPA	then gets harder.  I like this game as it does not take a whole lot of time to play one game but it is challenging.  I recommend this for people who love crosswords but like me aren't ready to tackle the New York Times crossword.
1	B004KSAIPA	Do not like this one.  Not really a crossword as the answers have many letters that stand alone.  Found to be very difficult & not fun at all.
3	B004KSAIPA	Fun!!! This is a fabulous way to spend time in a doctor's office or anywhere you have to wait on services. It is engrossing and draws other people into your circle.
3	B004KSAIPA	It would definitely help to have a Brittish friend to help you out with this one.  If you are familiar with the colloquialism or vernacular of those who speak the Queen's English, then you will have a better time with this.  Thank goodness for the feature that allows you to reveal a single letter or the entire word!  I love crossword puzzles so I do enjoy this challenge.
3	B004KSAIPA	If you love crossword puzzles, this one is great.  It works perfectly.  Using it is intuitive and if you get stuck you can get hints at your own discretion.  Some of the words are British English, but an American English version is available.  If you are looking for a crossword puzzle, you should give this one a try.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great crossword puzzle game! It is challenging enough to make my brain feel stimulated, but not overwhelmed. I have struggled to stay awake just to do &#34;one more clue&#34;!It is very likely written by a Brit as the clues sometimes include a colloquialism that we Americans don't use, but there are options to reveal a letter, a word or the whole puzzle when you get stuck. There is also an easy way to check if your words are correct. When you select this option, it gives you a further option to figure out your errors on your own or to have them pointed out to you.
3	B004KSAIPA	I like the clue list - different view than the grid. My kind of game and lots of puzzles.  Enjoy it.
3	B004KSAIPA	I've had a lot of fun with the crossword app.  It makes you think about what is needed for the amount of letters available. I'm 75years old so it's good for "feeding" my brain.
3	B004KSAIPA	Great app I learn new words everyday. If you get stuck there is different ways to get help.  l like that i can stop and it saves where you leave off .
1	B004KSAIPA	All the puzzles are on the same pattern, with very basic structure and simplistic clues.  Have seen better puzzles written by 8th graders.  No way these are written by a "professional" as claimed in the description.  Am deleting it and will wait for a decent puzzle app.
3	B004KSAIPA	I have never been able to work crossword puzzles and I have always wanted to learn. These puzzles are workable and hints are provided in the form of letters. You can also check your work (if you want to). This app is worth money.
2	B004KSAIPA	There are some better crossword apps out there. This one is pretty user friendly and easy to use . No real complaints.
3	B004KSAIPA	I've never been good at crosswords and get impatient to solve them.  I LOVE the choices here ... single letter hints, full word, wrong letter highlight, cross through answered clues.  This is my kind of puzzle!
3	B004KSAIPA	You'll enjoy these puzzles!!!  No, they're not as difficult as the NY Times Sunday Puzzle...then again, they aren't so easy as not to be challenging.  I have them on my Fire as well as my cell.  Excellent for those boring times standing in line or when the car breaks down & the tow truck is on the way!!!
3	B004KSAIPA	Good app for crossword fans, not too hard but not extremely easy either.  Grids are easy to fill in and to correct.
3	B004KSAIPA	A must have! This is so much fun and there are so many different levels to challenge you. I highly recommend this app.
2	B004KSAIPA	Have not used it that much yet. I like the help features, Glad it was free since they don't have alot of crosswords in the group.  Don't know if it refurbishes or not after you work them all.
1	B004KSAIPA	Beware!  Teazel had Crossword Lite with 202 puzzles. Update came through about a month ago and LOCKED all but 16 puzzles.  Luckily I have Titanium Backup and restored to the previous version. This version only added 48 puzzles for its price.  I don't mind them creating a paid-for app (which I would have considered buying like other apps that I have purchased), but to remove functionality down fron 202 puzzles to 16?  That's a ripoff and leads me to think twice about getting any other apps from them.
3	B004KSAIPA	this crossword app is great with many puzzles in it. they are a bit challenging but a downside is that some of clues given are a bit vague and answering it is the challenging part. overall i like very much.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great challenging game.  Provides all the right tools for hints when I get stumped!!  Good use of &#34;waiting&#34; times in doctor's offices, etc....
3	B004KSAIPA	This has been a fun and enjoyable challenge.  It's been entertaining alone or with the family! I highly recommend this enjoyable game!
3	B004KSAIPA	I've tried for years to &quot;get it&quot;.  So much fun to finally start to catch on! I still need hints now &amp; again but enjoy finding the cross-clues and the &quot;aha&quot; factor is great. Happy to have paid the $2.00. Puzzles are well worth a penny apiece.
3	B004KSAIPA	It's &#34;OK&#34; but not quite as good as the SCRABBLE CROSSWORD GAME by HASBRO.  I tried several of them before my conclusion of that fact!
3	B004KSAIPA	this is an intelligent crossword with a large variety of words. but not too hard for the average persons to enjoy. the helps are good and give you options on the level of assistance you want.
1	B004KSAIPA	These are British crosswords made for the American market?  Almost.  Unfortunately,  the British spelling and British idioms and colloquial expressions make these puzzles fine for a Brit but put me at a disadvantage.  The partial grid format with missing squares makes it even more difficult to fill in answers.  Too many answers are left dangling.  Had I realized that these were British, I would not have purchased them. I generally don't go anywhere near this type of grid format, either.  I don't recommend them to anyone.
3	B004KSAIPA	Another brain stimulate.  I wish the puzzles were bigger.  These are somewhat limited probably due to screen size.  I'm used to larger paper ones.  A really good way to pass the time while waiting for appointments, etc.
1	B004KSAIPA	There is not enough connectedness between words.  Too many hanging bits and pieces.  Crossword isn't readily engaging.  Now is the time
2	B004KSAIPA	I do admit to really enjoying a good Sunday paper crossword. I didn't expect this to rate as high as that, but admit to disappointment with this. I don't have as much fun with this one. Now, I didn't know the Russian gun, but I've never so much as wished for a dictionary. The words don't intersect enough to really catch a clue from them if you need one, which is a lot of the point of a crossword.If you want to spend a few minutes in a non-challenging sort of way that may or may not brush up your vocabulary it might be useful. If you have spent any amount of time with a good crossword, better find another one.
2	B004KSAIPA	I just prefer the real paper puzzles over the virtual ones. Three out of five stars because of that !
3	B004KSAIPA	Great for a beginner like me.  Easy to navigate and get help.Plenty of puzzles.Great for the price.  Addictive.
3	B004KSAIPA	The clues that are available for both letter and word questions are a huge help when you're stuck for a solution. I also like the highlight that shows if you've missed a word,which word it was.
3	B004KSAIPA	I very much like this game and would recommend it to anyone else-it has been a lot of fun doing these
3	B004KSAIPA	Who doesn't like crossword puzzles?!  I have really enjoyed working crosswords...  Fun and challenging.  I work the &#34;easy&#34; crosswords, but, am definitely going to try the 'medium',  and of course,  the 'hard' ....  You don't really have to have an expansive vocabulary in order to work crosswords...
3	B004KSAIPA	this app is definitely worth the money. there are a lot of puzzles and they are fun to solve. if you like crosswords youll like the app, plain and simple.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great crosswords app!  Granted, these puzzles aren't really difficult, but there are enough tough(ish) clues to keep it interesting.  It is British English, as noted by other reviewers, but that only adds to the interest.  (If you want US English, this developer makes a version like that, as well.)  At this time, there are 300 puzzles (great deal for 99 cents) and the developer says there may be even more to come, at no charge.  (I have seen from other reviews, that they have already done this once, or twice.)  The puzzles are separated into "packs" and the puzzles seem to get a bit harder as one advances through the pack.The game play is very simple and there are options to check answers and to show how you want clues displayed, etc.  The graphics are fine - nothing flashy, but I am actually thankful for that.  There are just two little things that I wish were different. Sometimes, I get a message that my "unplayed" puzzles are "locked."  To get around this, exit the game and come back.  Also, I wish they could lift the keyboard up a bit, as I sometimes hit icons on the menu bar at the bottom.  Those are just two small concerns, not even enough to remove a star from the rating.  This is a great game that I highly recommend.
1	B004KSAIPA	Disappointed with this supposedly free app.  Puzzle words aren't interconnected.  Can't access answers without buying the product. Took it right off my Kindle...
3	B004KSAIPA	great fun. I do crosswords all the time, and some of these are a challenge.  it stimulates the brain just fine
3	B004KSAIPA	I really love crossword on my kindle fire. I have played it every chance I get. And I Recommend it highly.
3	B004KSAIPA	I have not done many crossword puzzles so this was a great one to start that journey.In general,  does not rival the difficulty of the newspaper crossword puzzles, but that is what we wanted.
2	B004KSAIPA	This app is ok but I think it's just a little bit hard at times. I had to use the reveal answer several times
3	B004KSAIPA	great place to start doing crossword puzzles.  easy but tricky.  can get them done when you have a few minutes to spare.
3	B004KSAIPA	Not too hard not too easy. This app should please even the crossword beginners and the old crossword pros. Lots of fun. Everyone should have fun with this.
3	B004KSAIPA	ALWAYS, ALWAYS keep my puzzle close to me.  I let my grandkids play too.  Everyone who sees a tablet asks if I have crosswords, and I never disappoint..
3	B004KSAIPA	It is a good time killer while waiting at the doctor or any other kind of appointment. The puzzles are challenging with out being too difficult.
3	B004KSAIPA	The answers are varied. The clues are not obvious. It's nice to have so many puzzles at your disposal. Unlike the newspaper, you don't get bloc ks of surrounding letters for help. You have to use your brains and fill in like &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;.
3	B004KSAIPA	I got this app about two years ago and it is always nice to have a puzzle to kill some time with. It really comes in handy at the airport waiting for boarding, the jury room waiting for selection, etc. The puzzles difficulty varies from easy to medium and you can get help with a letter or even the word if you get stuck. You can check your answers for correctness at any time you wish too. It is a nice app that I would recommend to any crossword fan.
3	B004KSAIPA	Excellent brain teaser.  Great supplement to the daily newspaper puzzle.  Looking forward to the next one every time I finish.
3	B004KSAIPA	The puzzles are fairly simple and makes for a way to relax in the evening.  I do have trouble getting my letters going the right direction.
3	B004KSAIPA	These puzzles made a recent long and boring air trip from WI to AZ fly.  Excuse the pun. Puzzles are challenging without being frustrating. Well worth the small price.
3	B004KSAIPA	As I take my Fire with me everywhere., this is my favorite crossword app.  Just the amount of ease/difficultly.  Thank you so much.
3	B004KSAIPA	Crosswords really help pass time while waiting at the airport , and it stimulates thinking!!  I had the free download but became really addicted and had to have more!
3	B004KSAIPA	Great fun!  Really works the brain, but not so difficult that you feel clueless. Definitely worth the price!  I like that there are two different views for each clue.
2	B004KSAIPA	Other than being a little too easy, I really like the ease of playing, it is very understandable and uncomplicated.  Sarah
3	B004KSAIPA	A decent little crossword puzzle app. Hardly the NY Times but passes the time nicely. Oh, if you've tried free version, then this just unlocks the rest of the puzzles.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is a great crossword puzzle app My husband and I did it together on a long drive to pass the time.
3	B004KSAIPA	I've always loved doing crosswords but my vision has gone downhill over the years and I'm finding it harder to do the ones in the puzzle mags and the large print ones are usually pretty lame. Like, just because we can't see well doesn't mean we're dumb!This app is satisfying my crossword urge! It's a good mix of easy and more difficult clues and not a lot of repetition like so many print crossword mags have.  I don't mind the British spellings and terms at all since I'm a bit of an Anglophile anyway.The worst part is hitting the wrong letter on the on-screen keyboard or the wrong box to fill in, but I've got a stylus on order which should help!
1	B004KSAIPA	I didn't buy this app for one reason: shoot, I go through 200 puzzles in 2 months. what then? buy another app?there must be a gazillion puzzles with solutions out there in the public domain. why not set up a database the app can draw from?  or just charge a buck to load another 200? THAT would be a revenue stream, by jingo.people are much too kind rating apps - why give a 4- or 5-star rating to an inadequate app?
3	B004KSAIPA	Its very a good puzzle.  Sometimes you have to be creative when coming up with the right word. Overall, its a great time consumer and a little challenging.
3	B004KSAIPA	I like these puzzles. The games are not that easy. I like that you can ask for a letter when you get stuck. I get stuck a lot on some of them. I am getting better the more I play.
3	B004KSAIPA	This has to be the best set of crosswords I have had the pleasure of trying to solve.  Hours of fun!
3	B004KSAIPA	Not too easy, but yet not too hard. It's a great way to pass the time when you still want to use your brain.
3	B004KSAIPA	I am one of those people who has never managed to learn how to do crossword puzzles. I like puzzles and do a lot of them, but I find that with the right app, I will do puzzles of types that have never worked for me.This is an excellent app for a beginner. I go through the puzzle and put in the words I know. I might stop and not come back until another day at that point and try a second time. But the third time I can ask to have the puzzle checked for mistakes, and I can ask to have the mistakes shown to me. I can ask for clues, one letter or one word at a time. There are some words I will NEVER get no matter how long I try. But there are a lot of words that I will get if I have one or two letters to work from.
3	B004KSAIPA	...Very addictive...relaxing...turn on some music and work on puzzles...a few hard ones but that's what makes it fun..try it and see
3	B004KSAIPA	This app helps keep your mind active and is nice for road trips. I used it for a road trip with my mom and grandmother and we all enjoyed figuring out the crosswords provided.
2	B004KSAIPA	Overall the puzzles are pretty good; however, &#34;British&#34; spelling is used for many words and slang terms (e.g., colour vs. color).
3	B004KSAIPA	Title says it all.  But since I need 20 words, I'll go on to say that my spouse and I enjoy it right before going to sleep.
2	B004KSAIPA	I really really like this app and I am NOT a cross word person. I had gotten the free version and wanted more so just got the full game. I wish the full version would fill in the first free puzzles that I had already worked on. :( Other than that disappointment it has been great!
2	B004KSAIPA	should have levels easy med hard.  the ones available are good.  I totally enjoy what was there but really since we are not using paper should get more for the money.  I buy cross words every month and spent $3 for the entire month
3	B004KSAIPA	this is fun and easy to use ... I admit I keep morewords.com open on my browser when I work these puzzles
2	B004KSAIPA	Although some of the clues are a bit odd, there are enough puzzles in the full version to keep you occupied for a long while. I feel this was money well spent.
1	B004KSAIPA	Put this on my kindle thinking all crosswords are alike - just some harder than others.  WRONG! Worst crossword puzzles I have ever seen. Can't wait to take it off my kindle and find a "normal" crossword.
2	B004KSAIPA	Many of the puzzles use the British spelling of words (e.g. switching the &quot;r&quot; and &quot;e&quot; at the end of a word), British words you may have never heard of, and cultural references that you may not get. It wouldn't be so bad if it was mixed into puzzles here and there (I would view it as a learning opportunity), however it is frequently more than half of a single puzzle. Seriously, I've heard of a truncheon, but what the heck is a cosh (which btw is showing up as a misspelled word).
3	B004KSAIPA	This the app to have if you are enjoy crossword puzzles. I highly recommend it to both beginner and guru.
3	B004KSAIPA	great crossword puzzle. love it would recommend. this puzzle to any one. try it out. hope you enjoy it too.
3	B004KSAIPA	This is an excellent game if you don't want to buy crossword books or play on newspapers. I guess the only minor downfall is the common use of British terms that I hand never heard of.
3	B004KSAIPA	I never really enjoyed crossword puzzles in the past but not only this teaching me to be a better player ... I'm learning a few things too.
3	B004KSAIPA	I don't know if it makes me better or worse over-thinking and missing the obvious or not being a crossword minded person. It helps to be able to check how you are doing, get hints on letters or even words if you choose. The full version is cheap for what you get, I doubt I'll finish them all anytime soon.
3	B004KSAIPA	I loved this app. I'm a kid so some pf the hints didn't help but this was a fun crossword puzzle and I love them!!!!
3	B004KSAIPA	I really enjoy Crossword but it might be halpful to note that it must have been created in the UK/Canada because some of the answers have the British (as opposed to American) spelling.
3	B004KSAIPA	This app is very addictive. As others have said, it's not hard, but it's not entry level either. Good way to use up some spare time.
1	B004KSAIPA	I found a much better word search, it's by Oak-systems.com. So I just deleted this one. live and learn by experience.
1	B004KSJCXO	this is a trial 30 app. To bad it stated free in Amazon store. I guess they meant free download. Not worth the time to dl. State 30 DAY TRIAL JUNK
1	B004KSJCXO	I spent quite a bit of time inputting all my monthly bills that I would need reminders for and then sat back and waited for those reminders to come.  In the beginning they did, but then the notifications stopped.  I emailed the developer and got no response.  Uninstalled and went with Google Calendar on my PC and synced it with my phone.  So far, so good.
2	B004KSJCXO	I love the idea of the Bill Reminder but it does not have what I needed and it took forever for me to figure out the app. I just got another one that is better suited to me.
1	B004KSJCXO	this app is a trial app. if I wanted to buy an app I'd have bought an app. UI is OK. some settings could be explained better.
3	B004KSJCXO	Its decent not great but decent. I would say its worth trying to see if its what you are looking for.
1	B004KSKFJE	My grandson, who is 8, did not like this game at all.  He said it did not look like real graphs.  He does not recommend this game.
3	B004KSKFJE	I heard spear fishing and I was in awesome game love to go underwater so I was like best underwater game yet you should make a new one the great ocean and you can dive drive jet skies and dive off them or boats I would buy it have fun guys
3	B004KSKFJE	I love this game I got it and played it IT was fun it looks real IF JUST IF U HATE IT DON'T COMPLAIN! I GOT FREE 500 AMAZON COINS . But itshould be  fun and good for people who love fishing.
1	B004KSKFJE	I thought this was going to be a good game but nope. the map rodent ever change so you feel like you are going in circles. you have to stay on the reef too you cant go in the depths and shoot like octopus or something like that. horrible game and waste of money.
3	B004KSKFJE	best game ever, very addicting and fun to play,get this game it is BEAST!!!!!!! This is the best game on my kindle fire
3	B004KSKFJE	This is a fun game. It is very challenging and difficult to hit anything at first. My 6 year old son got frustrated at first but now he really likes this game. The graphics are great. I would recommend.
3	B004KSNSBG	So glad the full version of this game is finally available. Great puzzles and a well-made app. The only thing I would've added was a timer but I wouldn't have liked my time anyway - some of these puzzles are tough! Keep the puzzles coming.
3	B004KSNSBG	A fine introduction to cryptic crosswords for those of us making the transition.Still on the first set and enjoying the ride. Some of the clues are truly clever and bring a smile, laugh or even the occasional groan.So much more rewarding than sudoku...or standard crosswords for that matter.Recommended.
3	B004KSNSBG	Easy to use. No complaints. Cryptics are my favorite crosswords and I can never find enough of them so finding 100 of them in 1 place is great.
3	B004KSNSBG	Great for beginners new to this type of crossword. Challenging, but not too hard. Some of the answers are words I've never heard (maybe they're British), but using the hint mode you can still figure out the answers.
3	B004KSNSBG	Lots of great puzzles, intuitive interface. If you've never solved cryptic crosswords before, be sure to check out the help section for guidance - these aren't your typical US newspaper crosswords.
1	B004KSNSBG	I picked this puzzle based on the ratings and higher difficulty level,  but the clues were so confusing that I ended up deleting the app. this was a waste of money for me.
3	B004KSNSBG	Fun puzzles. Some familiarity with UK English might be needed, but I'm doing fine as an American. Nice price. Recommended app for cryptic fans.
3	B004KSNSBG	I always do the daily crosswords in the USA newspapers.  When traveling to UK I tried the versions in the local British newspapers.  The format and logic are very divergent from ours.  Each clue has two to three hints of how to find the answer.  If you arise waking the normal USA crossword, you will be perplexed by the difference. However, if you are up to trying new challenges and may even be bored with typical crossword, you may enjoy the sport of it all. I have both and do like to stray away from the typical to do these. They are kind of bizarre at first.
3	B004KSNSBG	Cryptic crosswords are very difficult to find. These do quite nicely. Not too easy and not too hard. I still prefer paper and pencil but this is a pretty easy app to get along with on my Kindle Fire.
3	B004KSNSBG	Have played cryptic crosswords since I was in Jr. high. I loved them then; still love them now that I'm a grandmother. These puzzles are just cryptic enough that they are challenging without being frustrating. Try them. I'm sure you'll like them.
1	B004KT7YM4	It won't sync with my online thing and I can't even figure out how I'm supposed to use the coupons with it
1	B004KT7YM4	Was not what I was looking for so did not get far enough into it to give a fair rating or review.
2	B004KT7YM4	Grocery IQ has coupon.com center and you can put scanned label into it. Not saying what comes up is right and you may have to fix it. I use it mainly for remembering the odd things that I don't use often.
1	B004KT7YM4	won't sinc as advertised, put too much work into setting it up to find it doesn't sinc, which is what i wanted it for!
3	B004KT7YM4	This is an amazing app. I have been using it as my grocery list for a few months now. It's very easy to use. You can add you're favorite store, move the aisles around to customize it to your store, & move pre-determined items to for where you find them in your store. Plus you have access to the online coupons from coupon.com. Your selected coupons will be sent to your email where you can print it off from your computer. I love it!
3	B004KT7YM4	Well, now the wife can save a few trees by sending me shopping lists via Grocery IQ instead of scribbling a list out on paper.  Also, she gets to tell me which brand she wants (I habitually get whatever is one sale or the cheapest).  She just adds items to the list, the list is synced between our phones, and I'm ready to pick up a few things on my way home from work.  Can detail which store the item needs to be gotten at if not sold everywhere, which is a nice touch.  Setup via barcode scanning works pretty well, but store brands may be a little trouble.
3	B004KT7YM4	hard to use so I think it needs a little more work. So if you get it understand that it is a work in progress.
1	B004KT7YM4	I downloaded this and deleted it almost immediately it was hard for me to navigate. I would recommend more specific and visual demonstrations at the beginning of the app to help lean how it works.
3	B004KT7YM4	The past few days I've been trying out grocery shopping programs on my Kindle Fire HD and have even purchased a couple of then and have found Grocery IQ to be the easiest to use, understand and set up.Also the bar code scanner reads and finds the items better than the scanners in the other programs.The only draw back I have found with it is that there is no way to enter the tax where it will automatically enter it so you'll know the total cost when you are checking out. If the programmer could update the program to figure the tax automatically he would have the ultimate program as far as I'm concerned.Don't waste your money on other grocery shopping programs when you can get Grocery IQ for Free.
3	B004KT7YM4	I love this app because you can make your grocery list and look at all available coupons. The app emails you the coupons so you can print them with the click of a button.
3	B004KT7YM4	I HAVEN'T USED IT TO THE MAX YET SO MAY BE JUMPING THE GUN.  SEEMS EASY TO USE. I HAVEN'T DELETED ANY LISTS YET SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT PART OF IT GOES. I HAVE BIG HOPES FOR THIS APP.
2	B004KT7YM4	Takes too much time to just DO a shopping this way for me. With special needs children I have to get in the store and out. I prefer getting my lists together at home by researching the advertisements online, looking through my coupons that I have at home (coupons I'm going to use I keep in an envelope I bring to the store) and then picking a few stores with the best local deals. If there's a particular deal I really want in on at a store that's at a distance or a bit out of the way then I'll make my &#34;comp&#34; list for Target or Wal-Mart and go there sometime in the evening without the children to get those deals. (remember though they do not DOUBLE coupons) This is probably a great app for others but I already have a system that works for me. :)
3	B004KT7YM4	I use this every week when I have to make my list for grocery shopping.  I can't seem to print the coupons though, wish I could, because there are always coupons in there that I could currently use.
3	B004KT7YM4	I downloaded Grocery IQ when it first came out on my iPhone and i have used it ever since. They finally came out with an iPad one and I used it on both of my devices (thanks to their online account sync). Now that I traded the iPad for a Fire I am using it on that as well. You must know that Grocery IQ allows you to setup an online account. This account allows you to connect multiple devices and keep the lists synced between them. In fact, you can even use your browser to type in items and they will be synced to the device the next time you use the app. That makes this purchase much more value-added than other list apps. Plus you get an app that is backed up by a good company with a solid product.
3	B004KT7YM4	Update as of February 4, 2013:  The new version of Grocery IQ (2.6.2) just released on Amazon.com fixes the list synch problem!  I had submitted the problem to Grocery IQ support and they were very responsive to my email (thanks!).  It's good to have a fully functioning and enhanced version of Grocery IQ running on my Kindle Fire!The synching of lists between Kindle Fire version and web browser version used to work fine until about 1 month or so ago.  Now nothing gets synched between the 2 - even though I'm using exact same account to login to both Kindle Fire version and web browser version.  Something broke that needs fixed.  As other reviewers have stated, we continue to get error message "The network is currently unavailable.  Please try again later."  But that's not the case in terms of my network being available since all other applications and browsing work just fine.  Will increase the review rating once the synch is fixed again.
3	B004KT7YM4	The tool itself is great, fast and easy to use;  I like that I can put the aisles in order based on my local store.The coupons still don't work;  I can't print then at home, nor at work.  Unless coupons are what you are after, the product is great.
2	B004KT7YM4	The basic application is pretty good.  It is disappointing that the stores I shop and have savings cards for are not available... especially the super stores.Also on my kindle fire am not able to save edited or added aisles.  Either I am doing something wrong or the app has an issue.I would give this app 5 IF the two issues mentioned are fixed.
3	B004KT7YM4	After testing a few different grocery/list apps, I've come to like this one the best. I'm able to create multiple lists (we create one for each store - Cub, Costco, Target, etc.) and save different dollar amounts so you can compare and save, and see how much money you'll be spending that day at the stores. It syncs across all devices, and I can share with my husband.The only thing I wish it did is keep the dollar amounts for items in the favorites list, inherent with each list, instead of having to go to that list's history to grab items with prices.
3	B004KT7YM4	IQ Grocery has already helped me save a lot of money.  Helps me find coupons for the items I am shopping for.
2	B004KT7YM4	Works good but not as self filling as I had hoped. Thought it would scan and load product description not just the UPC and you tell it the rest.
3	B004KT7YM4	Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.01)To me, in the world of Android grocery lists, there are two major players. There's a few more, but I really don't feel like the android version of grocery king or OI shopping list stand up to these two. So that leaves you with Grocery IQ and Mighty Grocery. While both are target the same audience. And Grocery IQ is free, mighty grocery does have a lot of features, enough that the $3 could very well be justified.Grocery IQ:When I started using this, I had a lot of sync issues which turned me off of this. But I recently tried it again, and the sync worked this time around. It's simplified, compared to mighty grocery. Quick lists, easy ui, can share lists between say you and your wifes/husbands phone. Does a pretty good job organizing, ok barcode scanning, and can email list to yourself. Overall, for free, it's extremely useable, and worth the download. The only thing that really annoyed me are the coupons, uses coupons.com service, which makes you jump through a lot of hoops to actually get a coupon printed out.Mighty GroceryI was actually pretty satisfied using the free version of mighty grocery, until amazon decided to give the full version away. Even the free version does a great job of auto-categorizing the foods you enter. And it goes well beyond just that, letting you customize the aisles/categories and predefining food to go into which. If you're motivated, you can really strategize the hell out of your shopping trip. Full version adds things like recipes, extends predefined lists, backup, barcode scan, configurable tabs, and screen rotation. Which a few of those actually come in pretty handy. Because of the amount of features, certain areas of mighty grocery definitely take some time getting used to. UI is good for what it is, but you definitely can find yourself getting lost. Having so many options with things like predefined catalogs, recipes, and so many options to share, are the real selling points to me. I can dump lists to facebook, springpad, my email, dropbox, etc. And starting with my previous list is essential for my shopping needs.Winner? To me, they are both great applications, and grocery IQ being free makes it totally worthwile. But for me, i still love mighty grocery. It's worth the $3. After I took the time to get used to it, i can't go to anything else. Try the free version, compare yourself.
1	B004KT7YM4	Had been using for 6 months.  Got update yesterday and every item had stored for those months was gone. Plus it won't let me store store brands like I did before.
3	B004KT7YM4	For me, there was a bit of a learning curve on this product, but once I got it, I found that I love this app.  Most items that I was looking to add to my list were not built into the database so I had finagle my list by using the closest item and rename.  Sounds complicated, but since you only build your list one time into favorites, it was acceptable to me. I never did understand how the aisles work, but since I shop in multiple stores, it really was not necessary to sort my list that way. Sorting by departments works just as well.I use the list on my Kindle Fire, so the barcode scanning does not work, but that is ok since I do not shop brand specific items.  One of the main frustrations is when adding prices.  There is no decimal point, you have to add the dollar, then go back and add the cents.  However, the way grocery stores are always price adjusting and size adjusting this proved to be an unnecessary function and I just do not use it.I noticed a previous reviewer said you can sort by stores - I have yet to find a listing of stores.  Cannot find a button that gives me this option.  There is a button that lets you add your own stores and specific lists for those stores, but no built in store lists.If you are looking for a basic, but very functional, app for making you weekly grocery list, check out GroceryIQ.  Once you get the swing of things, you will love it.
1	B004KT7YM4	I could not get any further in the application because of all of the coupons being offered.  While coupons are not a bad thing, these popped up sooften that I could not get to the shopping list part of the program.
3	B004KT7YM4	Use it every time i go to the store. makes life easier when shopping. i like it very very much.
2	B004KT7YM4	I use this all the time. I like that it will automatically sync between my KFHD and my iPod. It does need work though, it's sometimes too confusing, especially when entering new items. Also confusing/annoying is the inability to enter a new item and specify the aisle/catagory or add custom categories, and that unlisted items end up in the "other" category.Bug Note: Categories on Apple version (Spices & Baking) mismatched with Android/Kindle version (Beverages).
1	B004KT7YM4	A massive piece of bloatware from the same company that brought you the coupon-printing (when it worked) spyware for Windows.  I'd rather pay full price than put my phone to work for this company's profit.
3	B004KT7YM4	I like the ability to immediately get coupons and the functionality of the App. Ex. The way you can organize the aisles according to the place and way you shop! Great App!
2	B004KT7YM4	Using this as a straightforward grocery list, it works better than a simple "note" app.  It finds known products by search or UPC scan (with ubiquitous free scanning app) and lets you mark products you buy frequently as "favorites".  It removes checked off items in a history instead of deleting them sans-record, so you can always go back and recover something you've bought before.On the "coupons" end of things, "Grocery iQ" and "The Coupons App" redirect to the same website.  There you'll be required to install a bloaty, information-stealing desktop application on your PC in order to printout coupons.  If the company had any interest in customer convenience or morality, the coupons would be delivered to the Android apps themselves.My recommendation is to use a friendlier web-based coupon source and limit this app to grocery listing only.  Even then, I've since switched to "Mighty Grocery" for that, since it seems generously less data-miney.  Grab it for a couple bucks, or free when it rolls through the Amazon Daily Free App promotion.  I can't say if either product database is superior to one or the other, or if they're even different.  Same (store brand) items weren't found on either, and same items were found, thus far.As always, YMMV and I'm unaffiliated with any app, company, or interested party.
1	B004KT7YM4	Excellent concept. Looks nice. Can't add and categorize new items on the Kindle Fire becauce it's lacking an "add/enter" button. This is the most important detail for me to save some time in the grocery store. 1 star worthy. Will be willing to try again if this major glitch is updated. Still looking for something comparable.
1	B004KT7YM4	I Deleted this app. It was just way to much work. I found a better grocery app that I like much more. that one shows you sales in different stores. this one I just got places to put lists. and then cross them off. I can write them on a piece of paper just as easily :)
1	B004KT7YM4	I used to enjoy using this app, but It has become unbearable slow, often freezing up for several seconds.  Syncing with their web site is also very slow.  I am switching to a different app.
1	B004KT7YM4	I was hoping for something that would have scannable grocery coupons, but this doesn't have that function...so I don't really get much benefit out of it.
1	B004KTFPHA	The mechanics are buggy, but the worst part is the level design, very very poor level design.Looks very much like Kolf for KDE, makes me wonder how much work is actually the author's.
2	B004KTFPHA	it seemed pretty descent for the first game. but now its just stuck on game loading 00/100? i dont know what the issue is but gonna try to kill task n reload a few more times.
2	B004KTFPHA	For a free game its perfectly worth downloading. However its way over priced at its original price. It works well on my Xoom, doubt it'll get much play but its has a spot in the app draw.
1	B004KTFPHA	This app is a direct ripoff of the free game Kolf for Linux.  Even the courses are the same.The original program is licensed under the Gnu General Public License, which means you CAN take this free program, modify it and sell it, but if you do so, you are REQUIRED to provide the source code.  I don't see any source code for this app.The graphics are terrible, even for a free game, but for a game that costs $2.50, it is unacceptable.  The sound is alright, though there are only a hand full of sounds in the entire game.  Controls are exactly the same as in Kolf, that is, easy to aim but nearly impossible to control the power.  There are typos EVERYWHERE.  I've already paid for this app, then they want me to spend more money to buy courses (99 cents each) which were free under Linux? That's zero stars right there.This app looks exactly like someone took a free app from Linux, ported it to Android, slapped a price tag on it, and is trying to make a few quick bucks for his 15 minutes of work.
2	B004KTFPHA	I would have never paid for this, but it is entertaining enough. Tried out the beginner course amd it is pretty  darn hard. The controls are easy to learn, but not perfect. Wish there was an even easier course and maybe an improvement in the strength of hitting the ball. Even the lowest amount can be too much in some situations.
3	B004KTFPHA	Don't you people understand that this person is a troll and like most trolls if u ignore them they go away
3	B004KTFPHA	Think of all that extra work the AmaZon legal dept is going to have for publishing a game that is licensed under GNU license. And I hope the Developer gets a nice copyright infringement lawsuit.I expect more from Amazon though.
1	B004KTFPHA	This is some kind of game, not golf. I swung and swung and swung my phone but nuthin happens. Fix it and 5 stars. e
2	B004KTFPHA	this app isn't the greatest, it's pretty basic and can waste time in moments of boredom and I have just this to say regarding all the commotion about superman75 if he makes you laugh, great but alittle sad and if you don't like him, don't encourage him, you know, don't poke the bear :)
3	B004KTFPHA	This game was fun and simple to learn. I was playing in a few minutes and played a couple of the 18 hole courses that came in. This normally isn't my cup of tea, but I would consider this a decent game with how long I actually did want to stick with it. The graphics are sub-par but efficient to get the job done.If mini-golf is something you'd like, or would like the challenge of improving your game through some practice, then you might consider this. And $2.50 isn't that bad a price for a game.
1	B004KTFPHA	beat 9 holes in less than 5 mins. surely they jest with the price it normally is! glad it was free.
3	B004KTFPHA	requires whole corses to be completed to buy / win points to play other corses. I would prefer to dip in to any course for a casual game.
2	B004KTFPHA	installed this game to see if it was as bad as other reviewers said it was. It was just an OK game, you can move it the the SD card which is a plus. The actual game play isn't very engaging, but the controls are nice. The graphics are pretty plain, just nothing that made me want to play it again. Glad I didn't pay for it though.
2	B004KTFPHA	First off, the directions for this game are riddled with typos that make the directions make no.sense at some points. Secondly, in the picture at the beginning, it shows the ball being angled with a curve, but when you play you will see you can only angle the ball straight, which is kind of frustrating. Lastly, you have to make in app purchases for coins to play certain courses on a paid app! I might keep this app around for the kids to fool around with, but there is no way I would've paid.anything for this sub-par app, (pun intended).
3	B004KTFPHA	Great way to past the time....  Being a golfer I can appreciate this game!!! At first you would think it would be easy, but you will find it gets harder.....
1	B004KTFPHA	Who cares if this is ripped off.  I'm sure plenty of people complaining about that own either Apple or Microsoft products of some sort at home.  Both companies have done this sort of thing in the past, so that's not a big deal... sorry for my digressions...The game is not challenging, the graphics are weak, the gameplay is dull.  I'm surprised that anyone would actually pay for this.Super Nintendo golf came out decades ago and is still better... and is also better than almost any other sub-par Android Golf game.Pass on this one, even if it's free.
3	B004KTFPHA	i love this game.  i use kindle fire.  it's difficult that reviews require a word minimum.  there's only so much to say.  i like the noises.  i hate the water cause i am not good at that or the moving island things.  if you are like me and must beat a game you will have long entertainment.
1	B004KTFPHA	Boring to play but the graphics are good. I guess I am just not that into golf as I thought I would be.
1	B004KTFPHA	Horrible gameplay bad controls and grammatical errors make this game kind of a joke. With the competition like it is, you really gotta step it up.
3	B004KTFPHA	While this game does have very basic graphics, it's incredibly fun to play.* The courses range from decently easy to pretty hard.* There are not only built-in courses, but courses you can &#34;buy&#34; by getting points from playing on the free courses.* These courses you can &#34;buy&#34; are also player-created, which allows for some interesting courses.I would highly recommend this game, it's one of my go-to games for casual, quick playing.
2	B004KTFPHA	People, leaving stupid comments is everyone's right. Superman 75 is not an elite, he's just a chump that gets off by reading comments about him.
3	B004KTFPHA	This game is worth 4 stars but I think it's being underrated here because it doesn't look as pretty as a game from a big name company.  The game play is fun!  The control system works really well.Perhaps the level of difficulty should be adjustable for those who don't like the 'magnetic' holes.I do think though that the regular price is too high for a game of this level.  Either $0.99 or $1.49 would be more appropriate.
2	B004KTFPHA	It's a game inspired by minigolf (not golf, as some other posters have compared it with), but it doesn't use a physics engine. It's a top-down game that's meant to be a decent video game first.The problem is that the app isn't worth buying, and it uses in-app purchases on top of that. It also seems to ask you if you want to spend coins &quot;download&quot; a new course, but doesn't directly say its a &quot;purchase&quot; or his much it would cost. Maybe it does after you click &quot;download&quot;, but I've never tried it.So, because I don't want to get accidentially charged for something, I uninstalled. Btw, there are better games exactly like this that are a) free, b) have level editors. You really shouldn't have to buy new courses or otherwise &quot;earn&quot; them.
3	B004KTFPHA	Looking for a game that helps waste 5-10 minutes?  This is it!No long levels, no waiting to the next save-point, or waiting until the last wave of attackers before turning it off... Just a simple time-killer and kinda fun too!
3	B004KTFPHA	Just to humor myself, I decided to give this "golf" game a try. Fortunately, my expectations were not too high.Let me begin by saying that golf is not a game for the poor, nor one to be played on a dang phone. It is tradiionally played by a nation's elite, among whom I consider myself a member.Now, it appears these developers have created a "golf" app meant for our nation's peasantry. An app that would allow our commoners to momentarily feel the awe and wonder of standing on a green, staring down an immaculately kept fairway, and then having all creation hold its breath as you prepare to drive your ball.Well, don't get your hopes up blue collar America, because suprisingly, this game captures none of that. It is what it is; tis a poor man's golfing app, and an app appropriately named - Golfoid.Now to wash my hands and get back to day four of the Australian Masters.
3	B004KTFPHA	This is a great little game. It reminds me of playing pool on Android. I will keep it and have fun with it.
2	B004KTFPHA	It isn't horrible. The game play is smooth and responsive on the motorola razr. I got bored pretty fast. can't see spending 2.50 on this game as I have gotten way better for less. Worth a shot as the free app of the day.
2	B004KTFPHA	So I decided to try this game even though I normally won't touch something with less than 4 stars. Turns out it's fun but frustrating. Still a 3 star app though.
1	B004KTFPHA	Virus found by ESET Mobile Security, uninstalled. Sorry, but I won't tolerate infected apps and spyware variants no matter how the app meets any of my needs. You would think Amazon would scan these apps, but I guess it's buyer beware here.
1	B004KTFPHA	doesn't look that great for a golf game app. would be more impressed if graphics were better. but, it is nice that the app was given away for Free.
1	B004KTFPHA	dirty cheap!... i m glad to get this free apps of the day... when i select different course and it's going to charge me for 99 cents?&quot;  come on! give me a break!Angry Birds and Where is my Water is the best of all!uninstall Mini Golf!!!T mo G2
2	B004KTFPHA	move but a centimeter at a time which makes ur score awful! Please fix to get a higher star rating.
3	B004KTFPHA	A lot of fun and requires a lot of skill. Just the kind of thing to play with your friends competitively
1	B004KTFPHA	this morning as I was leaving brunch and I was assaulted by a mob of shoeless beggar leper children wanting my money! of course I didn't give them a penny, I told them to go get jobs, bastards! when I got into my Ferrari I noticed my phone was missing, obviously it was stolen by the &quot;occupy brunch&quot; beggars. after having my security team break the beggars arms and legs I finally got my phone back, and the dirty leper children downloaded this hideous Golf'Kid app!I had to replace my entire security team because they smell like beggars now, I will be incinerating my phone after writing this then I have to go to my doctor and get tested for poverty! all because this app attracted the poor to play golf on my phone!
1	B004KTFPHA	Runs fine on Droid Razr. As far as the game goes, it's a pathetic attempt at a minigolf game. I would expect to see these graphics and physics on an old school Razr from 2005. Someone needs to explain to the dev that the whole appeal of minigolf is to make obstacles entertaining, not a punishment that kicks you in the berries and steals your wallet. I forced myself to stumble through 5 full rounds to give the app a real chance to see if there was a decent game buried in there but only found myself wincing as the difficulty ramped up. They're well beyond &quot;challenging&quot; and deep into &quot;punishing&quot; territory. Trying to softly take ten shots to keep a ball on a curving little strip of grass surrounded by water with no other obstacles is just plain lazy design to snag a buck.I guarantee the dev has zero intention of playing the game himself and as others have said, I'm pretty sure I played this game years ago on my pocket pc and thought it sucked then too.
1	B004KTI95A	This is the same app you can download on an Android Phone.  Works great on phone.  Looks terrible on my Kindle Fire.
2	B004KTI95A	This is not an actual review of this app, but rather an response to another reviewer who complained that he never was dealt a straight flush..The odds of receiving a straight flush in standard poker is I believe more than 72,000 to 1
3	B004KTI95A	great game , i'm totally pleased with it to make ten poker hands on one board is an easy way to spend a stress free few minutes and it hasn't gotten boring or slow one bit
3	B004KTI95A	Just a fun game to play and with options of play. I would recommend this game to those who like to play card games.
3	B004KTI95A	Think about what to do before you can't take it back.  Have a plan for scoring the most points. After a couple of games, I'm done.
3	B004KTI95A	this app has TWO stars (which typically causes me to not even LOOK at an app) simply because of two idiots talking about the hands someone was dealt or not dealt.  This is a fun game by a reputable developer.  Inane comments, if they must be made, belong in the forums.
3	B004KTI95A	I have really enjoyed this game especially since you need strategies to win and score high.  It's easy to play and I've spent hours playing it trying to beat my last score.  If you like playing against yourself and previous scores, check it out.  I don't think you will be dissapointed. This game was also available on the Kindle Paperwhite and have waited for one for the Kindle Fire.
1	B004KTI95A	in 100 hands not even one time were there cards to make a straight flush. That's about 3000 cards. This game is written very poorly...BORING. plus the cards are tiny
3	B004KTLKVU	i love this app!!! its extremly helpful!!!!! (; if you wanna look hotter and cuter please please please download this!. theirs lots and lots and lots of tips and i used every one of them and i look way more beautiful then b4!! they have hair care tips,nail care tips, makeup tips, and much more!!!!
1	B004KTLKVU	this game is really boring and actually its. not a game but its basic things that I already know like get rid of pimples. ummm I already knew that! DONT BUYYYY
3	B004KTLKVU	This app is a miracle if u follow it. It will change ur life. Get this app and u will look as cute as me. ( ps. makes u more popular 2. )
3	B004KTLKVU	this has to be one of my favorite apps you should get it the tips work I have tried most of the tips and the tips never run out
3	B004KTLKVU	Like I said about the Natural Beauty Tips, I love these types of apps. I am all for a beauty app. Anything that's helps me look hotter.......LOVE IT!!!! Like I said, TALK ABOUT FAB!!! Me and my bff have never looked hotter with these tips. I also recommend Natural Beauty Tips. There are way more tips. I think there are like 160!!
2	B004KTLKVU	Its ok but i know most of the stuff its not very helpful im only eleven so dont need to do any of that stuff yet
3	B004KTLKVU	It was fun to read all the tings that were on here, the ones that I saw were pretty simple though. Like &#34;Conditioning your hair helps control frizz.&#34; A little bit boring.
1	B004KTLKVU	I would've liked to see a more in depth analysis of everything with pictures & possible video, but it is not bad for a free app.
2	B004KTLKVU	It's not that good it gives some helpful tips but most of them are like duhhhh. I was expecting something a little better.
3	B004KTLKVU	I know it might take a while to get it to upload but it is totally worth it! I just absolutely love the tips! Some might sound weird but just trust this app! :)
2	B004KTLKVU	I bought this one my Kindle Fire and it is an okay app. Its just all beauty tips, page by page.. to get to the next beauty tip all you have to do is swipe your finger. Simple as that. The tips are some I have heard before, some are not. It something good to have, something to read on a trip or when bored.
1	B004KTLKVU	don't get this app I wasted 10 min of my life itsxa leak game don't get it its is so bad I don't like I look at the pic its not fun
3	B004KTLKVU	I love this app it helps a lot with beauty. I think this app is really helpfull. I think I would help a lot of people looking for amazing beauty tips. I would recommened this app.
3	B004KU0IPI	I went into labor on Aug. 6th with my second baby and this app was very helpful. With my first child I kept track on paper and it was hard to focus on the times through the pain. This was so easy to push a button when they started and stopped.
3	B004KU0IPI	I used this in early labor for 17 hours before it was clearly time to head to the hospital!  It really worked well on my Kindle Fire.
3	B004KU0IPI	I'm in my final weeks of pregnancy for my 8th child and I keep asking myself where was this neat little app with my other children? No more counting the seconds away on a watch or scratching numbers down on paper when you are half awake, this nifty little app allows you to keep track of duration and timing of contractions and even alerts you when its time to head to the hospital. I like that I can look back and see how many contractions I had and when, so I can alert my doctor or midwife as to the possibility of preterm labor, or simply how often I am feeling braxton hicks. I have used this both on my DroidX2 and my Kindle Fire tablet with absolutely no problems.
3	B004KU0IPI	I did not get to use this app since I ended up getting induced, however I did test it and it seems like it would be useful for running contractions.
3	B004KU0IPI	This app was great unless you needed to edit the contraction times.  I would suggest the full version if you don't have someone dedicated to timing your contractions.  It will throw off your 20 minute and 60 minute averages.
3	B004KU0IPI	I used this app while in labor with my son. It was very easy to use, and helped me time when it was time to get to the hospital. I wish I had it when I wad in labor with my daughter.
3	B004KU0IPI	We used this when my wife started having contractions. When you or your partner is in contractions you are going to have a hard time keeping track of contractions. This app is perfect and the price is great. It even tells you when it's time to go to the hospital. Keep in mind that it doesn't know if there are other issues in your pregnancy or labor so this is designed for an average, healthy labor and at the first sign or first feeling of something wrong you should contact your doctor.
3	B004KU2JZU	A good game, because it allows me to win which most of like to do at times.  Easy to naviagate.
3	B004KU2JZU	A lot of games. Really like the categories so I can find a new game I might like. Adds don't get in the way.
3	B004KU2JZU	android ice cream sandwich  Zeki, 7&#34; tablet. Works perfectly. tons of different solitaire games. some completely new to me. clear graphics.choice of packs,  thoroughly enjoyable.
3	B004KU2JZU	A very large selection of games, and skill levels.Hours of entertainment.Very entertaining and a great time killer for everyone.
3	B004KU2JZU	Awesome app... does what it's supposed to do.  Runs fast and smooth on my Droid 2.  Graphics are decent and the selection of games is superb.
3	B004KU2JZU	best solitaire I've found.  Nice variety, easy game play.  It is ad based, but the ads are not intrusive. Keeps stats on all your games.
3	B004KU2JZU	device: FireThis game set is just a BLAST and contains so many kinds of Solitaire that I haven't played them all yet. It has a game for every Solitaire desire, that's for sure! MOST highly recommended!
3	B004KU2JZU	Easy to play ,but can only get so far without having to purchase points to keep playing it. Rules okay
3	B004KU2JZU	Fun and easy and many options.  Nice way to burn up time in the doctor's office.  Great screens and easy to follow instructions.
3	B004KU2JZU	Got this to play freecell.  Normally I use PC notebook but I was quite pleasantly surprised by playability on kindle fire. When I first tried it the cards were way too small and the borders way too large. An update a few days later fixed that.  I tried others but kept this one.
3	B004KU2JZU	Great feature: move the stack and only the card that belongs on the new stack is highlighted. Not a lot of games, but I am playing the free version.
3	B004KU2JZU	Great game of solitaire for all of the lovers of the game and with the price being free, you can't miss with this one on your Kindle Fire.
3	B004KU2JZU	great solitaire game.  there are many different games to choose from.  great if you only got a few minutes or you&apos;re bored. my only complaint is I wish the graphics were better.
3	B004KU2JZU	Great way to pass the time and a great range of games to choose from.  I spend a lot of time on this app
2	B004KU2JZU	Has potential, but the cards and playing surface are too small to use comfortably on the 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD.
3	B004KU2JZU	Has the best selection of different games. Easy to learn new games, the directions are very easy to follow! I highly recommend this app!!
3	B004KU2JZU	hey i like it for a free game my thrid game i down loaded today i just played one game and lost but hey i'll be playing more for sure
3	B004KU2JZU	i&apos;ve always wanted to learn more card games a la solitaire. this would be more fun on a bigger screen as the cards are small, even with the double tap feature. but its not a big deal, still got addicted to the game!
3	B004KU2JZU	I don't have solitaire on my computer and missed it badly.  This is a great collection of solitaire games that I play very often!
3	B004KU2JZU	I downloaded this app for my Kindle Fire and was very surprised at how many games were included! I don't remember reading how many were included, but there are over 50 solitare card games. You can view the games by skill level, number of decks used in play, type of game, etc. The app tracks your scores and times for each game you play. I really like this app especially since it's free! The only negative thing I can say about the app is the graphics used are a little dated. Other than that this is a great game for you Kindle Fire!
3	B004KU2JZU	I enjoy the variety of games. They provide great fun and challenges. I have learned some games I had not seen before._@
3	B004KU2JZU	I enjoy this gaming app but I gave it four stars because of the instructions. If you've never played some of the games on the app, the instructions are hard to understand. I have to play many times before I understand the game. More times then not, I just look up the game online to figure out how to play.other then that negative, the app is awesome.
3	B004KU2JZU	If reading a book can't knock me out for the night, this game sure will do it. Put's me out every night and another big plus is that my husband hates it, so I don't ever have to fight with him over who's going to play next.
3	B004KU2JZU	If you are looking for an awesome and fun solitare game this is the one!However it should come with a warning, may become addictive.Especially with so many choices.Hour and hours of fun and different games you can actually win.One of my favorites, Spider One Suite. Ok got to get back to a new game.Don't hesitiate just download it now!
3	B004KU2JZU	I had to try a bunch of free solitaire games that also had Pyramid, Golf, etc until I got to this one I found it to be the best so far but to be fair tried a few more free various makers (about 10 or so) and kept coming back to this as the best. with Pyramid it has the 3 various types. I was getting frustrated on some that didn't have the correct rules but this one has it and more. I had the Hoyle PC game of 100's of variety solitaire games and knew how to play most. I can't recall how many varieties this one had but maybe 15-20?  it has ads but they are small at the top and yoou have the option to move it elsewhere on your screen. Very clean and appealing sceen set up for game with options to change backgrounds but i didn't use it. A lot of options that are worthy to have. I highly recommend this one.  I use it on the Kindle Fire.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have been hunting for a solitare game close to what I play on computer.  I have installed, uninstalled many.  This one is a keeper!  Cards are not awkard to move and app visually appealing.  I love spider and they have three levels.  Many other options as well.  My new favorite time killer.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have been playing this game pack for years on both my phone and kindle fire. Have tried others...they are nice but this one is so straight to the point and offers so much variety I always come back!
3	B004KU2JZU	I have found no problems with the app. I enjoy using it, and I am addicted to Yukon. Good graphics.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have learn a few new solitaire games because of this app. I love it. It works on my pandigital.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have this on my Kindle Fire, and it works pretty well, I think.  It has locked up on me a couple times, always while I'm trying to change the card backs.  There's a ton of games, and instructions for the ones you haven't tried yet.  I like the choice of many backgrounds, but would appreciate more choices for card backs.
3	B004KU2JZU	I like playing games and for a freebie this one is just fine.  Different backgrounds, decks and I see no need to purchase anything else!
3	B004KU2JZU	I love playing Solitaire and this one has lots of different games that I enjoy playing wish it kept a running score.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love playing solitaire and this pack has a wide variety of games.  I have 2 favorites that I play all the time which is Picture Gallery and Trefoil.  Picture Gallery is very difficult and I don't win very much but it helps my thinking power. I play this for hours on end.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love Solitaire, and this has enough to keep me interested inplaying daily.  I LOVE that I can pick up my Kindle Fire andplay a game on it when/wherever I might be.  Love that someof these fun games are also FREE apps.  A keeper for me!
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this app.  I play Cat's Tail all the time and have learned that there really is a strategy to solitaire that makes it possible to finish the game pretty regularly.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this game!  best free solitaire app and if I played more solitaire apps, I might say nest solitaire app period.  so many fun versions and mo shuffling!
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this version. This application took an addictive game and made it extremely addictive.Very enjoyable game play on Gal Tab.
3	B004KU2JZU	I really enjoy the Solitair Free Pack app for the Kindly Fire HD.  I enjoy playing all types of solitaire games.
3	B004KU2JZU	I really like the variety of games available.So far this is the best Solitaire selection of games I have found
3	B004KU2JZU	I really like this game and recommend it as almost required Android gaming.  All Windows installs come with Solitaire, right?  So why not all Android installs as well??Any game with full-screen Tablet support is always welcome by me, and this game has that complete support for my tablet, while running flawlessly.  That's right, this game doesn't run in a box or a window; it scales to your screen format and resolution.  The way it should be.There are an INSANE amount of Solitaire variations included in this pack.  The ads are very minimal in this release as well.  I can see myself buying the paid version of this one day, just to support the creators, but this version is no slouch.  I'm all about Klondike Unlimited and Three Towers, but there's so many more versions included here.  Free all the time, too.  It's only like a 5MB download; so don't worry about bloatware here.  Shouldn't all OSes come with a copy of Solitaire to play?  I'd like to think so.  Download this free game, you won't regret it.
3	B004KU2JZU	It comes with 50 different solitaire games. I've never heard of half of them. I've only played a few, but they are great. I love all the options. Visually it is a little dated, but still fun to play.
3	B004KU2JZU	I tried several other card game packs, including two that cost $2.99 each, this one is the one to choose if you want a simple game pack that entertains and is low cost. This game pack has all the features, ease of use, and FANTASTIC graphics. The advertising is always in one small corner, and has had several ads that caught my attention.
3	B004KU2JZU	I've only been playing FreeCell in this games pack, but I think this version of FreeCell is the best one out there (of the free ones that I've tried).  It has unlimited undo's, back to the start of the game. You can move a card from the Aces area back to the tableau, provided that it's a legal move. These two features are absolutely  essential when you need to backtrack in order to find the solution. Game play is intuitive and it's easy to interact with. Game itself seems solid and robust.Even with the 'large card face' option selected, graphics are still slightly fuzzy on my Kindle Fire. It would be awesome if you could provide high density graphics for the Kindle Fire.
3	B004KU2JZU	I've played other solitaire games, but this is by far the best. Very smooth game play. A multitude of FUN games. Help on learning all of them. Customization of backgrounds and card backings are cool.
3	B004KU2JZU	I wanted a nice program to play some traditional solitaire. This software comes pre-loaded with a bunch of different solitaire games, many I have never heard of. The best part of this program is it explains how the games are played. So even if you don't know how to play, you can quickly learn the rules. Great time waster :)
1	B004KU2JZU	I wanted to like this. I really did. I don't play that many solitaire games, but the few that I do play I love. Unfortunately they didn't have any of them. Not one single one.Another thing the UI. It stinks. Navigation is not well thought out. For example, let us say that you are examining the list of games. You come across one that you wish to read the rules about. There is no button or anything telling you the rules. Instead, you have to hit the back button to go back to the main screen, then read the rules there. Why? Going back to the main screen is ridiculously stupid. It would make much more sense to have a button on the same page where you are examining the list of games, that says "Rules".I have to be honest here.250+ Solitaireis a much better free solitaire app. It allows you to not only get the rules straight away, but also you can view a demo in action of each game. How cool is that?!
3	B004KU2JZU	I wasn't sure about this pack but after getting it found this is very, very intertaining and very challenging...I like the variety of different games and that it goes from easy games to medium, to difficult.
3	B004KU2JZU	Juice to play a game that doesn't live up to your expectations or stops in. the middle of a game. one of my favorites!
3	B004KU2JZU	Keeps me occupied. Its nice to have a few choices to go to for some real card entertainment Nicely done
3	B004KU2JZU	Loads of options and tons of different solitaire games make this great.  Also, it uses high resolution graphics so the cards look good and are easy to read.  If you're looking for a good solitaire game this is what you want.  It has every form of Klondike plus Freecell, Golf, and countless others I never heard of.
3	B004KU2JZU	Love it. Love the different and various games. Easy to learn ones you have never played before.  Glad I downloaded it.
3	B004KU2JZU	Love this HUGE collection of Solitaire Games.We have a Leader International i10-50 Tablet PC and this downloaded and installed easily.  I don't know if this game app was designed to accommodate Tablets or not, but it does work just fine on ours.I am brand-new to this technology of apps / wi-fi / tablet pc
3	B004KU2JZU	Me and my daughter get lots of use playing this game. She has learned that there is alot of solitaire to play many games
3	B004KU2JZU	Much as I've wasted billions of seconds with a certain similar winx game, this too shall waste time! Good selection of games, good design, good gui mechanics.
3	B004KU2JZU	My Favorite is correctly stated.  This app on my Charly's Kindle is incredible. All my other solitaire apps have been removed. Why keep what you will never use again since all my favorite games are available on one application. I play several times a day as this is now my way to de-stress.
3	B004KU2JZU	My wife first got this app and uses it all the time and everywhere.. Everyone can find a game or 2 on this app.. Easy to use and hundreds of ways to play..
3	B004KU2JZU	Nice app that allows you to play pretty much any solitaire game that you would ever want.  Interface is a little odd at times, but other than that, it is a solid app.
1	B004KU2JZU	Not crazy about this app. I have played better solitaire games on my phone. I like the solitaire game on my computer a whole lot better.
3	B004KU2JZU	Ok, so the first thing I will say is FORGET the FREE version and go get the paid app. These guys deserve the money for putting together such an amazing product. Tesseract one up'd every Solitaire game known to man-kind in this package and it's worth $10 to get it, not the lowly $3.99 they are asking for the paid version.If you are a solitaire fan, you can't miss with the bajillion different varieties that this pack offers. The other thing is that if you find yourself playing more than 30 minutes a day on this game, get the paid version as the savings in battery life will amaze you. I played about an hour a day on the free version before purchasing the paid one. Her battery would drop about 25% on the free and about 15% on the paid. Those little ads require a lot of data radio usage to download.
3	B004KU2JZU	Perfect app for solitaire addicts. includes a big selection of different game versions all in one place. had 3 other apps before for different types of solitaire, then found this one and replaced them all.  looks good and has great functions/options, even instructions on how to play each one.  learner a new one everyday...
3	B004KU2JZU	played on my kindle fire. beautiful graphics. smooth game flow. lots of options. even choose ad location on free version. worth making a purchase to support Tesseract.
3	B004KU2JZU	Since I have downloaded this app I haven't been able to doing anything else.  There are so many different types and levels you can never get bored.
3	B004KU2JZU	Smooth game play, tons of games, and able to be modified for your taste. I have no use for any other card game app. I'm super impressed, especially for a free app. :) :) :)
3	B004KU2JZU	Solitaire Free pack is a mind, playing game some of time it can be easy or it can be hard how you beat the first time. Or the second time!!
3	B004KU2JZU	The games that came with my Tablet are good, but not my style! I found this at Amazon and enjoy it every day. Thanks!
3	B004KU2JZU	The movements and gestures took a few games to get used to; however, once you're familiar with it, it is fantastic. The app runs flawlessly on the Kindle Fire. I have not had a single issue. What I do have is a LARGE assortment of games I can play. When I downloaded, I thought it was a simple solitaire game. It is LOTS of games in one app. I'm definitely purchasing the Mega Pack once I learn all the games in this free pack. This has become a &quot;must have&quot; and stays out of the cloud and on my device.
3	B004KU2JZU	There are a whole lot of different kinds of games to choose from and now you can customize them to your liking!
2	B004KU2JZU	There are several different games inside this app which should make sure there is something for everyone.  My only complaint is the cards are very small (which isn't the apps fault, the cards need a certain amount of space).
3	B004KU2JZU	There is not really much that I can say other than this is solitaire. It's a good way to occupy myself waiting for a meeting or in a doctor's office.
3	B004KU2JZU	This app allows you to choose many types of solitaire to play, so there are endless possibilities.  It's a great value for a free program!  There are ads, but they are not intrusive.
3	B004KU2JZU	This app has every game of solitaire you can think of. We love it. There are games for everyone! It is highly addictive.
3	B004KU2JZU	This app is awesome, includes the classic Solitaire games we came to love along with a few that I have not played before.  A definite must for all classic Solitaire game lovers.
3	B004KU2JZU	this app is the best for solitaire games.  my face is Osmosis, which is a very hard game to find.  highly recommend!
3	B004KU2JZU	This app is the best I've seen for Solitaire! There are so many games to choose from, and the instructions are clear enough that it's easy to learn new games. I bought the paid version to support development because it's that awesome. The only things I would change would be to have the option to change the color of the face of the cards (white is too bright when playing in the dark) and to have a color-picker option for the table &amp; card backs. There are a lot of nice choices already included for table &amp; backs. This one is just me wanting that perfect shade of purple. :)
3	B004KU2JZU	This game is great! There are so many different versions of Solitaire. I always have my tablet so this is a great way to kill time if you are waiting at the doctors office. After it is downloaded you do not need an internet connection to play so this is also a great way to spend time if you happen to be riding in the car
3	B004KU2JZU	This has to be one of the best solitaire packs out there and it free. Has all my favorites and it runs smooth. What more could anyone want.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a great game and I love the reasonable permissions with it!  I'm playing it on a Droid X and have not had any problems... other than I'm playing it too much!  I've barely scratched the surface, though, as I see that there are many more variations of solitaire to choose from, most of which I've never heard of.  The instructions are very straightforward, though, so I'm sure I'll venture out and try something new one of these days.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is another one of those card games I like to play as with most card games , try it I think you will like it too
3	B004KU2JZU	This is currently one of my most used games on my Kindle Fire.  It has all the old solitaires I have played on Windows past, like Klondike, Golf, Spider, Freecell, and Tut's Tomb (called Pyramid here), and scores of ones I never heard of. Some have multiple skill levels.  My current fave is Penguin Easy, which resembles Freecell, and likewise is almost always winnable with enough thought.  If I want a really hard one I play Scorpion (win rate about 2%) or Miss Milligan (not won yet!).  Each game has detailed instructions. The ads are relatively unobtrusive in the upper left corner and can be moved.EDIT: I just discovered the paid version, Solitaire MegaPack, which has more than twice as many games and no ads. Some have complained about inappropriate ads; I have not seen any of those, but people who are having a problem with that might want to pop $2.99 for the paid version.
2	B004KU2JZU	This is just ok.  Moving cards during the game is cumbersome but it is workable.  Also it sometimes freezes up and you have to "undo" sometimes.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is more than standard solitaire.  It is many games sorted by skill level l.  The games are organized several ways.  Something for everyone.  plays well on Kindle Fire.  Quick, responsive,  very well done.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is my favorite app! If you love solitaire you will love this; tons of different games. My favorite is Montana (gaps).
3	B004KU2JZU	This is one of the better solitaire games out there. Tons of games, good controls and nice shortcuts.Good job, dev!
3	B004KU2JZU	This is the best free solitaire app I have found. I love all the game variation choices. Runs good on my HTC mytouch.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is the only Solitaire ap you need.  Tons of games and clear instuctions make this ap the best.  And you can save games in progress.
3	B004KU2JZU	This pack has a good selection of solitaire games.  I got it mostly because it has the &#34;golf&#34; version.I've been playing Fairway Golf on the Ipad, but they don't have an android version available.  So this is the next best thing.
3	B004KU2JZU	This pack is fun. It has a vast variety of games to choose from. The games go from super easy to difficult. Great to pass the time away.
3	B004KU2JZU	This solitaire pack is awesome! Who can beat a Free game pack that has options and is easy to use
3	B004KU2JZU	This turned out to be a nice game of solitaire.  I got it for a family member to play.  He was kept busy.
3	B004KU2JZU	This works pretty well on my NextBook7 tablet except for one thing--I can't get the game to rotate to vertical mode. Maybe that's just a setting I need to go into, but seems strange for this day & age. Minor complaint though as I like the huge variety of games. Oh, one more thing--one of my favorite games, Tri-Peaks, has a weird issue with not being able to access a card in a certain position making weird card play on that game. Overall, it's super for free!
3	B004KU2JZU	What I like best about this app is that it is MANY MANY games in one.You can play numerous solitaire card games all from this one app.Excellent!
3	B004KU2JZU	With dozens of games in varying skill levels and a range of playing times, you'll be addicted instantly.Classics, variations, and some lesser known games offer hours of exploration and great fun.Handy help and hint features make learning new games and rethinking strategy within each deal much easier than in other apps.A must-have.
3	B004KU2JZU	With over 50 games to play this free game is a lot of fun.  It can be a real time killer that you can use while waiting for someone.  I play it on the Kindle Fire and the graphics are pretty good.  It does show ads on the top of the screen but to be honest with you I go into such a zone playing the game I don't even know they are there.Overall this is a good game for free and the permissions use the internet to send you ads and not much else.  So far I am happy with the game.  I have not seen the poor taste ads others complained about or had any issues on my Kindle Fire.
3	B004KU2JZU	works flawlessly. love it. worth having on my EVO. more words to 20 word minimum . don&apos;t mention this is a great app grab it now
3	B004KU2JZU	WOW!  Get this app now!  I love the classic card playing - no silly birds, no brain struggles - just simple addiction.  And this app is beautiful....a huge plus in my book.  So far this one is flawless as well.  6 stars!
1	B004KU2JZU	I&apos;ve had this game for a while now and I can&apos;t seem to enjoy this game at all. I think two stars is sufficient.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a way to just pass time and it is always there with my Kindle Fire.  It is quick to reset a game and it keeps your score.
3	B004KU2JZU	I tried a couple different solitaire apps and this one is my favorite it has various games, but is the easiest to understand how to use.  With lots of different solitaire game options on this app.
3	B004KU2JZU	of course.  But this pack has a LOT of different games, easy to change games, tips for all games, good instructions, easy to change card graphics, and is well worth the time to download and the space to play.  A great many games to fit your desires and skill level.  Of course some are just luck, but it's fun to think that with really smart play you will win more.  I would recommend you grab this one and settle in front of the fire for some fun.
2	B004KU2JZU	I love the individual solitaire games in this pack. There is only a couple repeats of the same type. Otherwise, they are all completely unique and addicting. The only reason I don't still have this is if you uninstall it (or get a new tablet), you lose your progress and have to start all over again.
3	B004KU2JZU	This solitaire pack has 70+ games and they play smooth as silk on my generic tablet. I don't give 5 stars very often, but this game pack is tops.
3	B004KU2JZU	What's to say it works well, fills my Samsung S3 screen and dos a good job of entertaining me. -
2	B004KU2JZU	I used to enjoy a quick game now and again.  However, the adverts scrolling across the top of the board are not only distracting, they cover up half of the cards remaining in the deck.I would have given 5 stars; but the ads are so annoying that I no longer even play this game.
3	B004KU2JZU	This update made the playing area smaller and the ads bigger. Wish I hadn't updated. I am totally addicted to &quot;Montana Addiction&quot; but I won't be playing as much anymore.
3	B004KU2JZU	This app has a ton of games that it sometimes feels impossible to get to them all.  They have metadata for each game around skill level, luck, difficulty, etc.  That is a nice way to find new games pretty quickly that are in line with what you like in your solitaire games.  (The luck games drive me crazy so I hop right to skill.)  The instructions can sometimes be hard to follow because they are a page of text, so it would be nice if they added more interactive tutorials or something.  I also noticed what I think is a bug in the Kindle Fire version where a message pops up at the bottom and gets stuck there, even after I close the app and go back to the home screen.  But after a few minutes it does go away on its own.  Just annoying that you have to wait for it and can't close it yourself.  All in all I love this app and definitely recommend it.
3	B004KU2JZU	This pack of solitaire games offers many choices.  I do not like the colors inthe graphics, but the games and choices are great.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have several solitaire apps on my tablet, FIRE, and laptop.  Enjoy all of them.  Fun game that can be played anywhere.
3	B004KU2JZU	Play it from time to time. Lots of games to choose from to keep my mind busy. This is my second favorite solitaire collection.
2	B004KU2JZU	It is a lot of fun but have had a bit of trouble with it freezing on my android phone and kindle
3	B004KU2JZU	just like hearts and spades this is a good app to have i would recommend all three apps to everyone
3	B004KU2JZU	I have enjoyed playing this game and have installed it on my lap top, and husbands computter, and i'm looking to see what else I might want
3	B004KU2JZU	I have have had the program for about 6 months and it has works like i expected it to with any problems. Fun little game to pass a few minutes waiting somewhere.
3	B004KU2JZU	Fun to play when bored, there's a wide selection of games so you never get bored with the same game over and over. Great instructions on how to pay each game, in case you don't know.
3	B004KU2JZU	I have found this to be one of my favorite games/apps. I like learning all the different games and I challenge myself to try each one and not move on until I win at that particular solitaire.  Very challenging. Great Graphics. Good Instructions.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a great game! Fun & Addicting! Love It!!! Great layout, rotates with device. I play it nearly every day :0)
1	B004KU2JZU	this was a great free of solitaire until they updated the version.  it is everything you could want but with the update the screen is over large on my tablet. I may still use it on my phone but had to find a new one for my tablet. I had to reset my preferences with the update which is very sloppy.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a lot of fun.  I enjoy the challenge.  Could use more Free Cell type games.  I love it!
2	B004KU2JZU	Another app I downloaded for my device. Not as good as spider but not bad for free. Worth a look
3	B004KU2JZU	The pack has numerous versions of Solitaire games with multiple difficulty levels, from relaxed to difficult. I enjoy them all, depending on my mood!
3	B004KU2JZU	Lots of solitaire games to choose from.  I tend to play other games, though, so uninstalled this one.  I would recommend it.
1	B004KU2JZU	the latest upgrade ruined this app. The ads cause the game to force close in the. middle of a game. this is very frustrating
3	B004KU2JZU	Very well done app. Addicting, relaxing, challenging, responsive, fun!Even a time counter. But I play just to beat it & relax.Best I've found.
1	B004KU2JZU	I may delete this because the ads flashing in my face are very distracting!!!!  I really like the game but get rid of the big ads!!!
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a great collection of solitaire games with lovely graphics.  There are 18 categories with 2 or more variations per category.
3	B004KU2JZU	Love all the choices. I spend way too much time playing cards now.It has all my favorites, plus more to learn.
3	B004KU2JZU	I am a solitaire lover.  I play this game almost everyday.  I have had the Microsoft version on my laptop computer for many years.  I especially like the one that shows one card at a time instead of three.  I don't know the title of that one however.
3	B004KU2JZU	Sometimes you just want something to pass the time.  Many different solitaire games to pick from.  Works great on my kindle fire; and you have different options in the settings.  Good collection of solitaire card games, definitely would recommend to anyone wanting solitaire for kindle fire.
3	B004KU2JZU	i love the new card games that are introduced every so often keeps you inerested in playng new games when you are bored.
3	B004KU2JZU	My tablet does not come with our old favorite game, so I downloaded and tried several and this one works the best.
2	B004KU2JZU	I had a great solitaire game on my old Palm Pilot, and then I had a good game on my Kindle.  I have been having a hard time finding a solitaire pack I like.  This one is okay, but I would still like a better one.
1	B004KU2JZU	Don't use it and wont use it I think it is too slow and often hesitates and then I loss it.
3	B004KU2JZU	If you like playing solitaire, this is the free pack for you.  Great games, good rules, and lots of fun.
1	B004KU2JZU	This permission is entirely unnecessary and preventing me from downloading what is still, otherwise, an average app based on others' reviews.  Was going to at least try it, but phone call logs is a definite deal breaker.  They have no business knowing anything about who I call and who calls me.
1	B004KU2JZU	App forces close in the middle of a game.  It was my favorite app until four days ago. To slow.
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a great game you will love it if you love matching games,you total up to number thirteen ANY way you can have and two, ace and queen kings stand alone, there I basic told you how to play so try it you'll love it.
3	B004KU2JZU	Played this for a few weeks (loved it) then it suddenly said I couldn't access the game until I signed into my Amazon account. That just doesn't seem right so it's gone.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love solitaire, & this is a great game I found on my Kindle, even my 8 year old grandson has a fun time playing this game.
3	B004KU2JZU	Love it!This gives me several different games to play when I do not feel like reading a book and I am bored.
3	B004KU2JZU	this game is also very relaxing for me
3	B004KU2JZU	I have found so many great games within this download. My favorite is &#34;East Haven Easy&#34; which is anything but easy. So many different skill levels of games. Anyone/everyone can find something to play.
2	B004KU2JZU	For some reason, my KIndle fire does not seem to accept this program properly and jumps around when I try to play it.  Also, It is very difficult to change the game, for me to one of the others offered in this suite. Perhaps, I am a bit of an older model, who has a bit of trouble with &#34;new stuff&#34; since I come from an age where actual cards on a table were played for too many years to count!
3	B004KU2JZU	card games are great, no gambling with this either i don't like to pretend to gable either do not tru
1	B004KU2JZU	i am going to delete this app. I dislike that you cant change the settings easily and its just annoying.
3	B004KU2JZU	If you like card games on your computer then this should fit the bill perfectly and should provide you many hours of enjoyment.
3	B004KU2JZU	I HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS ONE AS YET BECAUSE I AM ENJOYING ANOTHER SOLITAIRE PACKAGE.  I WILL TRY IT THIS WEEK FOR SURE!!!!
3	B004KU2JZU	This game has more games than a lot of other solitaire games.  Others may have the usual klondike and a few others.  I like Scorpion.  This one has scorpion.
3	B004KU2JZU	So many games I never knew about.  I love solitaire card games and there are the best.  So many different ones.
1	B004KU2JZU	Don't use
3	B004KU2JZU	i like playing this game  it has multible solitaire games to choose from so you don't get bored  it is a good choice
2	B004KU2JZU	Annoying ads. They get in the way. In order to stop them you have to buy the app. Wouldn't mind so much but, the way they force you to make the purchase to me is unethical. Being on a Kindle you have to go outside Amazon to purchase the additional games. I don't recommend that course of action because of the chance you take picking up "viruses".
3	B004KU2JZU	I like solitaire in the first place and this set is pretty good. There are a couple of challenging hands to be had here.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love that there are hundreds of game styles to choose from all loaded into one great app!  For card-game lovers everywhere, this is truly the ultimate app for that!
3	B004KU2JZU	Solitaire Free Pack is a great value.  There are so many different types of solitaire to learn to play.  I downloaded it because I wanted the Monte Carlo game.  Eventually I will take time to learn more of the other games.
1	B004KU2JZU	Didn't like it, has since deleted this game from my Ipad.
3	B004KU2JZU	My husband and I both love this app. I use it when traveling and while waiting at the doctor s and he uses it waiting for me!
3	B004KU2JZU	Nice app, lots of games, easy to use and play. No problems with locking up, force stop....  Also nice it doesn't auto start in the background and suck juice like most of the apps seem to do.
2	B004KU2JZU	What did you do to my game?!  The new upgrades cause the game to be slower, with choppy card movements and simply not as clean.  Before the upgrade I would have given it a strong 4, but now it is a weak 3.  If it doesn't improve, I will probably stop playing.  I play on a Fire, so maybe its the device, but it is still disappointing.
3	B004KU2JZU	I take my Kindle with me when I go to Doctor appointments, etc, and this keeps me entertained in the waiting room!  Love this solitaire game.  It turns with your screen, so no matter which way you turn it, it is always upright.  Don't know what I would do without it now that I have it!
3	B004KU2JZU	I play solitair all the time.  It is a good mind stimulator.  Good memory tickler would recommend to all my friends.
3	B004KU2JZU	These was my fifth download of a solitaire game - yep 5 different games, but this one is just right.  Good size, easy to read, works great !
3	B004KU2JZU	Here is a great mix of games and fun.  Many I have never heard of but they now have instructions and help.  so there is no reason not to give it a try jump in and have fun what do you have to loose.
3	B004KU2JZU	Yeaaaaa ... it's one of the few games I have that I can actually play w/o the thing blowing up !! wooooo hoooooo ....
3	B004KU2JZU	I downloaded this app because I love playing solitaire and freecell and have been very pleased; it's really nice to have so many variations of solitaire in one package. With a small banner along the top edge, the ads are not distracting at all. The app works fine on both the Droid 3 and Galaxy 10.1.
3	B004KU2JZU	I play this game all the time.  Now, all of a sudden I keep getting full screen ads that make me back out of the game to get the ad to go away. Last night I was kicked out of a single game 3 times within 5 minutes because of the damn, full-screen, ad for Boars Head meats.  Make it stop or I will keep lowing your star level.  Before the full-screen ads this was a definite 5 star app.Edited 5/24 - looks like they read all of the complaints about the Boars Head ad.  I played all last night and this morning without it popping up.  I will re-adjust my star rating.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this pack. I think I play at least 3 games a day on here just to pass the time. It has such a great variety of games that you are bound to find one that you like.
3	B004KU2JZU	Now this app is really good. It has so many different games, some I never heard of before. And the directions on how to play them are easy to comprehend too. If you like solitaire like I do? This app is for you. And I don't even mind the pop up ads either. Marilyn from Remus, Michigan
3	B004KU2JZU	I like playing solitare. It helps pass the time. And keeps my mind active,and alert ,its so easy too play
3	B004KU2JZU	I enjoy playing this game.  It is good to pass the time while traveling or while at the doctor's office.
1	B004KU2JZU	I have played this for quite awhile.  It WAS an excellent app even with the ads. I'm glad I waited to review it as I can now only give two stars instead of the five I  would have given. It forces closed at least every other game on kindle fire.....a big disappointment
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this Solitaire Pack sooo much. I play it on my Kindle Fire all the time. They add new games regularly but I usually play the same ones, my favorites every day! If you like solitaire you'll have lots of fun with these games.
3	B004KU2JZU	I enjoy this game app very much. Increasing skill levels for games makes it intresting. Use it everyday of the week.
2	B004KU2JZU	I previously loaded this same app on my older tablet which had no ads running through it while playing.  I love most of these card games and it is definitely the best app I have found for them.  If someone knows of a way to eliminate the ad banner running across the top of the screen, please share!!!!!  They are taking up valuable screen space and are irritating!
3	B004KU2JZU	We love this Solitare game.  I bought the Kindle Fire for my wife who is afraid of anything technical. The device and the game is so easy to use she plays the game all the time.  The advertisements are only a slight distraction.
3	B004KU2JZU	I really like to play games on my iPad when I have a few minutes and want to wind down. Works great
3	B004KU2JZU	GOOD variety of choices of versions of the game.  Some games are really easy and some more challenging.  Good mix.
3	B004KU2JZU	Lots of games to choose from.  Some I did not know existed.  Learn a new game and enjoy the challenge.
3	B004KU2JZU	I've tried many Solitaire games, but this is by far the best for a FREE game.  So many background and card back choices.  It looks like something that you paid for.  Nothing rinky=dink about this game.
3	B004KU2JZU	I'm not much of a game player but there is enough variety in this app toi keep my busy during long downtime waiting periods on my job.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love this game. it is so addicting. the nicest part is that if u get bored with one game, there are a lot more to choose from. keep up the good work!
1	B004KU2JZU	The word hate does not fit, but there are better free solitaire games then this one. No longer have this one. removed
3	B004KU2JZU	A good solitare variety to pass the time.I think the graphs could be alittle better but overall I haven't had any issues.
2	B004KU2JZU	Tabby cat is my fav game BUT something has changed. The completed rows of ace to king now overlap the cards so I cant see the cards in the game. It drives me crazy! Please fix this!
3	B004KU2JZU	I love playing all the games, it seems to help time stand still while in a waiting room. Always pops up with slight tap. Easy to navigate for some people w/slight brain damage.
3	B004KU2JZU	It has many options on different types of solitaire games.  Game is updated periodically making the games more enjoyable.  I would recommend it to family and friends.
3	B004KU2JZU	Great variety of solitaire games. I had this version for over a year and the only bad things I can say about it is that with some updates the ads would get in the way of game play, and in portrait view I would rather see the menu bar run across the bottom of the screen. Overall a great free ap!
2	B004KU2JZU	good graphics. I found in entertaining to a certain point. good game to play when I'm not in the mood to play my other games.
3	B004KU2JZU	I'm enjoying the solitaire games on this.  I'm really hooked on Free Cell.  This offers lots of tips,choices, and backgrounds for all the games.
2	B004KU2JZU	This pack has many solitaire games to choose from.  I have spent a lot of time playing these while travelling or on my downtime.  The only thing I don't like is that there are no instructions.  There are games that I am not familiar with - and still have no clue how to play.  I just scratch my head and choose another game - there are plenty.  If you love Solitiare - don't miss this one!
1	B004KU2JZU	Don't bother. I love Solitaire but this version is a waste of time. There are better choices out there. Poor
2	B004KU2JZU	I have been addicted to this app because of the huge number of variations it offers.  However, recently the ad banners have increased in size just enough to partially  block the top row of cards.  Annoying beyond words. I understand that the app is free because of the ads, and I actually read them WITHOUT having to play in portrait mode to see all of the cards.  Bad move, y'all!
2	B004KU2JZU	I deleted this pretty quickly after I received.  While the games were fine, too many in one place tended to be confusing.  Better to have one game per app with superior graphics and instructions.  More is not necessarily better!
3	B004KU2JZU	Awesome app with many different ways to play solitaire! It makes for hours of fun for the whole family especially on bad weather days.
3	B004KU2JZU	I Like it because of the different games I get to play. Plus the I can learn to the  ones I don&#34;t know.
3	B004KU2JZU	love this app
3	B004KU2JZU	This is a fast easy way to keep my mind active, but also very addictive...when I don't even realize I have been playing for an hour!
3	B004KU2JZU	It's great for different varieties of the game but the graphics are not awesome.  I do play it all the time.
3	B004KU2JZU	THis is one of the best solitare apps I have found. You get a very good selection of games to choose from with directions on how to play each variation. The cards are easy to see and the app ressponds well. If you are looking for a good solitare app, this is the one.
2	B004KU2JZU	I seldom use it.  Other softwares are easier to use.
3	B004KU2JZU	This Pack had the game ACCORDIAN which is one of my favorite games that I have only found in one other gamepack. This is a great selection of games.sincereleigh
3	B004KU2JZU	If you like lots of different solitaire games, this pack has a lot of them.  They are fun to play, and you start a game over or go on to another at any time.
3	B004KU2JZU	As with other online solitaire games - program works well on Kindle Fire. Mindless brain-rest. Good selection of games and options.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love to play this game, when I do not have any thing else to do.  I think it is a great game and graphics are good.
2	B004KU2JZU	Okay for solitaire!
3	B004KU2JZU	All of a sudden the advertisements are a wider band and enter my games. THIS may end up being the reason I dump this app  and  not buy the ad free app. I WILL NOT be forced into buy anything. Would not have seemed so bad if the ads had been this size the whole time.THANK YOU FOR FIXING THE SIZE OF THE ADS.  WILL PROBABLY BUY THIS APP IN NEAR FUTURE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP. Cannot say that about any of my many other apps.THANKS again
3	B004KU2JZU	I like playing solitaire that it is a great card game to have on my kindle to play. It really works out for me.
3	B004KU2JZU	Works very well and has a wide range of solitare games. Instructions are not always clear but all in all great fun.
1	B004KU2JZU	was a great game.  it now force closes everytime I try to play.  I am removing from my fire.  if they correct problem I will use again.
1	B004KU2JZU	too much going on in this pack that I had trouble using it. I jsut downloaded a different one to play.
3	B004KU2JZU	I like the choice of games, I do seem to 'win' a little too often. TV is so boring, sometimes I just pick up my Kindle and play through a show while I wait for something better to come on.
2	B004KU2JZU	It's just a solitaire app. Nothing special. Get anyone of these games you want and you'll see no difference in the game.
2	B004KU2JZU	I liked being able to play each different type of solitaire.After the game updated, not all of the same choices were available.
3	B004KU2JZU	Many different games available for a wide variety. Never get bored playing. Many options for the background and the deck itself, too.
3	B004KU2JZU	I love Solitaire, and also love Klondike Solitaire spent a lot of time playing both, between them both its Klondike I like the best, I would tell all to down load both, a lot of fun for everyone.
1	B004KU2JZU	Cards way too small to play this game enjoyably. Don't need flashy fancy, it's all about the cards and they need to be big enough to see without a magnifying glass.
1	B004KU313Y	I used it for about 5 days and set it to the settings I felt would be fine and after doing so, I saw I had no need for it. It wasn't doing anything for my device.I even had a game that I had installed and it was sucking most of my battery/usage and this program did not help me with that, I had to discover it on my own.. so this program was of no use to me.
3	B004KU313Y	I love Auto Memory Manager.I first installed it on an Archos A7o Tablet because it wasn't running very smoothly and I had read that it was a good choice.  A good choice is an understatement.Auto Memory Manager made my A7o run smoother than it ever has, including the day I took it out of it's box.I have recently "rebuilt" my A7o tablet due to the fact that I just put too much junk on it and it wasn't running as smooth as it could.  With Amazon's new App Store, I am attempting to rebuild the device WITHOUT any of Google's own market on it...so I was really happy to find this Memory Manager available here.Just a quick note...this app does NOT replace the stock Android memory manager, it just allows you to control when it does it's thing.  It's pretty easy to use and really helped speed my tablet up.
3	B004KU313Y	Seems to work well.  Not having memory problems so don't really know if it is helping or not.  We will see
1	B004KU313Y	I don't really think this was what I was looking for. You can't have it automatically turn on when you turn on your tablet, and I didn't really see very much of a difference in performance when I had it turned on. Maybe someone with more expertise would like it.
1	B004KU313Y	I really don't know how well it works I didn't use it long. I no longer have the app in use.
3	B004KU313Y	Not a task killer, which you should not use!  This app allows you to adjust Android&apos;s own memory manager. You can make it a lot more aggressive, freeing up memory to your liking. This app is the first one I have used that keeps my phone running smoothly, without worrying about apps closing that I need, or causing glitchy performance. \n\nAndroid does a good job of managing memory, but if you are still having some memory issues, try it.  I have seen the difference by using seepu, and it does a good job!  (un-rooted Samsung Exhibit 4G)
3	B004KU5LHS	This app is great for track the monthly flu.  Gives you more insight into how everything works.  Would highly recommend it for the younger crowd as well.
3	B004KU5LHS	I love this app. it's accurate, and interactive. I like all the features it has built in. Even chat and forums.
3	B004KU5LHS	I use this tracking device  everyday. It help my doctor,husband and myself realize something was not right and that was why I was not conceiving  a baby. I would recommend this to all females even if you're not trying to have a baby. The only thing I would change is the charts. One this app for example the temperature chart is multiple months on one chart. It needs to be one chart per month that other monthly information could also go one. OVERALL A WINNER!
3	B004KU5LHS	I love this app! I have irregular bleeding, but this app still keeps track very well. I also love the forum feature.
3	B004KU5LHS	I love the Pink Pad.  It is right on with my menstrual cycle that it is scary at times. I never have to guess when it is coming.
3	B004KU5LHS	I have never been able to track my cycle until I started using PinkPad. This app makes it super easy. It's  cute but no nonsense and I really like that it tells me my most fertile days. Since I am NOT trying to conceive that is important info to know! I like that it has both month and days views and also that I can track my weight. This is all around a good and useful app. I have had it for a long time on my Kindle and have never had a problem wih it.
3	B004KU5LHS	Definitely worth it.. I can keep track of everything right in one spot. From moods to intimacy to weight tracking. Even the &quot;notes&quot; area was well planned out.Now if there were only a way to sync with other devices. I.e; kindle and cell.
3	B004KU5LHS	helps me keep track all the disscutions are great helps me threw a lot with family husband kids you get the support you are looking for
3	B004KU5LHS	I got this app for my kindle fire.  I started with the free version but I upgraded because I wanted the extra features.  Such as customized background,  fertility tracked.  Its great and now when you visit the doctors and they ask when was you're last period I don't have to guestimate.  Its also nice to keep track of symptoms.Works wonderfully on kindle fire.
3	B004KU5LHS	I used the free version for several months and it works great for tracking my cycle.  Plus a place to add notes like weight or illness etc.  I upgraded so I could use the graphing feature, have more mood choices....and I was tired of the standard background (not necessary but I enjoy being able to change it).  It also has features for tracking fertility/ovulation which I don't need but it is useful for others.  Great app for a great price even for the upgraded version!
3	B004KU5LHS	I tried the free version first but quickly updated. has all the features I wanted. totally worth the money. not sure if it totally right on my ovulation days...but it comes within 2 days of guessing when I will start.
3	B004KU5LHS	5 Stars all the way! This help so much for keeping track or watching for ovulation. It is almost spot on to the day if you're regular and if you're not it makes a lot of the guess a thing of the past. All the things you can keep daily record of for yourself or your doctor. I love this app and knowing when Mother Nature might so up!!!
2	B004KU5LHS	it does the basics of tracking the lovely business of being a woman, but with no finesse. there are little things about this that bother me. Such as, it allows you to describe your cervical mucus but then does not change you're predicted ovulation or note on the calendar you even had cervical mucus. it seems like I'm nit-picking here. I know that. My husband and I are trying to conceive and with a 12-24 hour window a month, it's all about the details. Also, it figures out the average length of your cycle and adjusts accordingly. That part I'm fine with. My husband &amp; I had a chemical pregnancy which caused my period to start over a week early and my average is now 22 days, throwing off the entire calendar, AND the app wont let me change the average. Overall, &quot;meh&quot; describes it perfectly. there are better apps out there. don't waste $3 on a mediocre one like this.
3	B004KU5LHS	I used this for a while on my blackberry (i think) and it has major improvements. i was using ovuview which was too messy, confusing and wrong. this caught on right away when i put my ovuview info in. looove it.
3	B004KU5LHS	Love this app. Works great and is only off by a day or two but I have only had it for a few months and it gets more accurate the more info I input (:
3	B004KU5LHS	I really love Pink Pad Pro and think it's a really good buy. I use it many times a day and it never freezes or stops. I recommend it for teen girls.
3	B004KU5LHS	It's awesome I love this app.All teens should have this app love it absolutely great. If u get it you wont regret it honestly no lie I am honestly satisfied and exited that my period wont be poppin up on me any more thank you for makin this app......!!!!!!!!
3	B004KU5LHS	I love that it helps me keep track of every aspect of my cycle not just my period. And the note section is awesome.
3	B004KU5LHS	I have been using pink pad for about two years now and I must say that I get a lot out of it.  I have always had irregular periods and found it difficult to always note the frequency, length, and flow of my cycle. Now with pink pad its easy! All I have to do is put in what day it starts and when I go to my GYN I can tell her of any issues and I know exactly when they occurred.  I'm not yet ready to start trying for children but when I am I will be sure to use pink pad. Another great feature is the weight tracker, input the weight for the day and it will automatically put it into graph form so you can see how you have been progressing in loosing, gaining or maintaining your weight. If you have internet access while using pink pad you can also connect to forums so you can get questions answered, get advice, or just speak with like minded women. All in all it is a great app for any woman who wants to keep better track of her weight, periods, ovulation or wants to connect to other women who are going through similar situations.
3	B004KU5LHS	Easy to use. I like it. It has many more options than the free version. I would recommend it to a friend.
3	B004KU5LHS	it is so helpful! it is an amazing app! its worth buying! I love it! you should really buy it! :)
3	B004KU5LHS	this app is most definitely a good one.  it also works well for pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant!
3	B004KU5LHS	love this app. not a waste of money. it helps keep track of everything and has a forum if you have any questions you need answered.
2	B004KU5LHS	Purchased this version because I didn't want to have to deal with the annoying ads while I was trying to put in data.  (It was a distraction to me.)  The only thing that this one does over the free version is that you are able to change background screens in one of the tabs--that and the ads are not here.  Save your money in the future and use the free version instead.  Good app, but not worth the $ paid.
3	B004KU5LHS	I&apos;ve been using this for a long time now and I love it.  I bought from andriod market but felt like doing a review so u know how good it is. Worth the money.
3	B004KU5LHS	I have been using this app for 2yrs.plus. Its accurate (according to my OBGYN) as long as you set it according to the way your body operates. It will give you the average options but everyone is not average so if you don't change from average it will tell you how your body should be operating; meaning....if your period starts on may 3rd the app will schedule for your period to end in the next 3 days and that will cause  your ovalation days to be off track on calendar it provides for you. Especially if you know your period  lasts more than 3days. So that's why its important to go to settings and reset everything (if your period is not average).
3	B004KU5LHS	This is a great period tracker and it tells you when your fertile days are, its great if you are trying to avoid pregnancy, predicting your upcoming period, or trying to get pregnant since it shows the fertile days. I wish I had this sooner, it would have saved me lots of accidents.
3	B004KU5LHS	I have had this app on my Kindle Fire for 3 months. It worked perfect to track fertility. I know because now I am PREGNANT! YAY!  fertility track was so accurate its crazy!
3	B004KU5LHS	This is a very useful app. I honestly have never been very good housekeeping track of my period, and honestly tend to lose track very easily. This very simple to use app has helped a lot.Unfortunately my son, played with my kindle and reset it to factory. I lost everything I had entered in the app. Hopefully it won't happen again. I hope having it connected to an email address will help prevent such a loss should it happen again.
2	B004KU5LHS	This app has some pretty decent features, and allows you to also track basal temp, weight, mood, symptoms, as well as flow-level.  I thought the paid-version would be more customizable, but really it only lets you change to display theme to one of a set of about 5 (none of which I liked).  I *wanted* to be able to customize my symptoms (I get super clumsy at certain times of the month, I think that's a symptom, dag-nabbit), but that wasn't a feature in this version (or in the free one, either).Still gets three stars, cuz it tracks things.
3	B004KU5LHS	This might be my favorite app. It isn't perfect, but it is very helpful. It's good to have something to remind me about my time of the month. Also, there's so many ways to post questions and polls on many topics such as nutrition, women's health, exercise, spirituality, etc.
3	B004KU5LHS	I got my first Kindle Fire almost 3 years ago &amp; Pink Pad Free was one of the first apps I downloaded. After a few months I upgraded to Pro &amp; have not been disappointed once with this app! It keeps track of my periods &amp; accurately predicts future ones. Props for the symptom tracker &amp; extra themes available. Definitely a must-have for ANY woman.
3	B004KU5LHS	Well I had the period tracker app before this one and I must say their are things I love about both. I'm a little sad there is no backup for this app at all. Period tracker had backup. Also the period tracker app I could input my own moods or symptoms, pink pad I cannot. If the period tracker app had a paid version, I would have bought it! I am satisfied with pink pad pro though, I like the option to change your background, I found having to input a flow in order to mark the days of your period a bit odd, but no big deal. I also really love the support system and groups where you can freely discuss that time of the month. Over all worth $1.99 in my opinion.
3	B004KU5LHS	Really easy intuitive app, checked out 4 others for monthly tracking and I really like this the best. Upload a photo to put on the cover of your journal, tracks symptoms,moods, fertility prediction all the basics in a easy to use tab style diary. Pink free is just as good honestly I just liked the app so much I purchased it.
3	B004KU5LHS	I use this app bi-weekly at least. Its great for keeping track of your period, mood swings, weight gain, and  Pms symptoms. Its also great to have access to a community of other women for bodily, emotional, and spiritual health. It gives a projection of your future periods and ovulations (hugely accurate) for travel and other planning. As well as sending you notifications for how ever long before your period you set them, to remind yourself to check and make sure your pads are in your purse :) Definately worth paying for the upgrade, but if you can't afford it the free version is still a really useful tool.
3	B004KU5LHS	I have a very busy life and this is great to have as a reminder plus I can add all that I need to...to help balance everything in my body...great app good job!!!!!
3	B004KU5LHS	I use this app a lot! I am not trying to get pregnant and I have menstrual issues, this app helps me keep track so I can report findings to my gyno on my yearly visits. Great tool. Every woman can use this!
3	B004KU5LHS	it tells my when im going to get my next periid saves my rfrom stuf juhb  hhu hhh uhbb hhh
3	B004KU5LHS	just what i needed
3	B004KU5LHS	Very helpful, great way for women to keep track of their monthly cycle and weight. This app is easy to use.
1	B004KU99LC	Simple is nice... but sometimes too much simplicity is simply weak.This player has only 2 functions:1. next/prev song (random)Randomize my entire mutli-gigabyte collection of music... really?2. rewind/ffwd 10 seconds within the current song.Oddly enough, it is the only Android player I currently know of that has the rewind/ff feature.  All the others have a position bar that works OK for short songs, but is almost useless for longer songs, not to mention podcasts.oh, yeah, there is one other thing it can do:3. Double Tap >> Play/Pause
3	B004KU99LC	this is the only music app library that randomizes all of your songs you dont have to touch anything i like it
1	B004KU99LC	S.d. card with music uploaded on it already is needed. Or it won't even let you use it. Really bad app.
1	B004KU99LC	DONT BOTHER GETTING THIS , ITS A JOKE CANT SAY MUCH ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS SO DUMB, STUPID, AND WASTE OF TIME
1	B004KU99LC	I hat this app iv tried to get 13. times. its the worst don't get it I'm warning you don't get it.
1	B004KU99LC	well...... the only bad thing is I have more songs on cloud. like roughly 150 more. so I was hoping it would be good for wen I'm in the car. I usually cant play all of the songs for a kindle cuz of no internet connection. so the songs like 150 more were downloaded to cloud. so wen I played music, it played my songs that I got for free and those songs I got long time ago. so it only played like 8 put of probably 170 songs. I wasn't happy.
1	B004KUP3F8	I was excited to find this app, but I have had it on my device for over a year, and still had not had a chance to use it, because Amazon provides so many Ebooks, I just never got around to using the Audiobooks app.That is, right up until last night.I found it difficult to go to sleep, and thought about picking up a book and reading till the sand man came knocking. But my eyes were not having it. Then it hit me, I'll use my Audiobooks, and listen to a story to help me sleep.Opening the app for the first time, it was really easy to navigate. I hit up the category I wanted, and selected a book. But being half asleep, I neglected to turn on my wifi. Of course it threw up a notification to turn on my wifi, and I did that when I realized my error. But then it threw up another notification, basically saying that there was an error with the download, and asked me to try again. So I did. And again, another notification, asking me to send an email reporting the problem. I skipped it the first time, but then gave in and sent out the email after 10 other books would not download.I received a prompt reply, that was obviously a &#34;pre-written, in case things go wrong&#34; general email, saying that the books are narrated by volunteers, and sometimes there are audio issues. It did not clarify why the books would not download, or if the problem was being looked into. Seems like a waste to me. I need a better app, because this one is just terrible. And I had such high hopes for it.And FYI, I know this app would not contain any major titles that are popular in this day and age, but even for a bunch of older books, it would have been nice. But for me, this app is a huge fail.Customer support is lame, and so is the app.
3	B004KUP3F8	Audiobooks gives you free access to tons of books, which you can select by a number of different criteria, including author, title, genre.  Don't look for the latest best sellers.  Only books in the public domain (basically older classics) are available.  But there are tons of them.  They are streaming downloads, so you have to have a data connection to use the app.  I love it.  Read a Sherlock Holmes story while you exercise.  Improve your body and your mind at the same time.
1	B004KUP3F8	I have an off brand Android device, that most programs work on, but,not this one. Maybe your tablet will run it.
3	B004KUP3F8	I really love it. great when you go to the gym or wait at an appointment. Use it alot and you can get free books.
3	B004KUP3F8	I like this because it has a lot of different books to read all on this one app but unfortunately I couldn't get it to work properly on my tablet
1	B004KUP3F8	I want to love this app and tried to download several different books.  Each time I received a message that there was no internet connection on both wifi and 4g
1	B004KUP3F8	I downloaded the app, and found it won't go on the SD card so until I buy a tablet, I had to delete it.  Didn't try it.
2	B004KUP3F8	Test devices:Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 officialViewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6I've been into audiobooks for years, having a long daily drive to and from work.  Getting audiobooks has certainly helped me get some daily literary time in.  Normally, I pick up titles from Audible, having a Gold account there that runs $15/mo, or one "free" book each month.  It's great and all, but, there are a load of classic titles that I've never read.  Enter this app, which contains a boat load of classics and other free domain titles.  Excellent!  Now I have more to listen to, and I can catch up on the classics.The app itself isn't bad, but it's not all that great either.  A lot of this comparison is coming from my experience with Audible's app, which I've been used both on Android and iOS.  Titles are downloaded to the SD card of your device, which is good because even though they are MP3, they can take up some serious space.  Being in MP3 format, you can play them back on any device that supports MP3, which is pretty much all of them these days.  The tracks themselves have no ID3 tagging information in them, so you may want to use an editor to add that stuff in.  While you can listen while you download, you can't just tell it to download and jump over to another title and have it download that too.  You're stuck there waiting for it to finish downloading before you can browse other titles.  Nor can you download only specific parts.  If you back out of the app (using the back button), it will stop downloading instead of continuing in the background.  Using the home button will let the download continue.  All downloads are dropped into a single folder on your SD card, with no sub folders for each title.  Each time you select a title, it jumps right to playing instead of letting you decide what you want.  And finally, it doesn't remember where you were last in your title.  Each time you start, it will take you right back to the beginning again.  To get back to where you were in a title, you will have to remember which section you were listening to and the rough time into the section, then manually navigate there.  The recordings themselves are pretty decent.  The narrators aren't pros, but do a decent job.Given the state of the app, I think I'll be downloading and using a different media player instead of the one Audiobooks includes.  It simply isn't versatile enough to get them job done.  There is a paid version of this app, which removes the in app ads, but give that I don't plan to use this app to do more than download, I'm not sure I want to spend the $ for the ad free version.
3	B004KUP3F8	As it says, it's classic books, so up front you know you won't be getting any of the latest hits, or anything close to it.With that being said, you have to review the app on what it says it is, which is classic books...and it's pretty good. The quality is always good, there's categories to pick from, and it plays smoothly. The controls for controlling play are solid. Every category has some good choices, there's quite a few older books for multiple tastes.Given that this app is free, it's a nice app to download and give it a try. It's a solid app.
2	B004KUP3F8	CAN NOT RATE THIS YET I TRIED TO USE SEVERAL TIMES. BUT I CAN NOT GET THIS TO WORK, I TRIED PDF FORMATS TOO THAT THAT DON'T WORK. I GET THE ERROR NOT CORRECT FORMAT,  I AM UNABLE TO GET THIS TO WORK.I TRIED TO FIND INSTRUCTIONS ON INTERNET BUT TO NO AVAIL.IF YOU CAN SEND ME INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO MAKE THIS WORK, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. I WOULD THEN BE ABLE TO RATE THIS.
1	B004KUP3F8	Although this was easy to install and a great concept, it just doesn't work.  I have tried to use it countless times and after perusing the vast laibrary, selecting a book and clicking on it, I have yet to get anything other than, &#34;Whoops, try again later.&#34;  I think if I could actually use it I would like it, however, all I can do is uninstall.  Maybe it is compatable with Acer, maybe it isn't, but I will never know.  A bust in my book, (or tablet as the case may be)
3	B004KUP3F8	Have used app previously and found it a functioning app, will try to use more often in days ahead Thanks.
3	B004KUP3F8	Good selection of free audiobooks.  Quality of the reading is excellent.  Works flawlessly on HTC Incredible.  Interface is easy to use.  Can browse by title or author and also search if you'd like.  Looking forward to seeing more titles added in the future.  Well done.
3	B004KUP3F8	i enjoy listening to the booksis hard for me to read, so this is perfectthe diferent types of stories makes it somuch interesting looking forward to listingfor a wile
2	B004KUP3F8	Not a bad app for being free. It seemed to always lose my place when I closed out of it. You have to shut it down from one specific place in the app, which frustrated me.
3	B004L03LKQ	My wife needed this as it was recommended by her diettician and she uses it daily. Great product for android smartphone.
2	B004L03LKQ	I was hoping for some real motivation by these daily notes.  I guess I had expectations too high for a free app.
1	B004L03LKQ	sure each page offers a couple sentences about an underlined food but there are no pictures, tips, or preperation/uses for them. what you do get, however, is a different advert, a different background color and that image of grapes up there on the Icon on each page.
1	B004L03LKQ	it sucks because there is no picture and it don't install right on the kindle fire so bottom line is it sucks like a donkeys butt
2	B004L03LKQ	I just downloaded this recently so I have not had a real chance to test it, but so far it seems good.
1	B004L03LKQ	It has a lot of information but I am not able to type in and do a search on foods.
3	B004L03LKQ	At your fingertips it give you great information on what vegetables can work for your body and what they do.Its a short list but you get the point.
3	B004L07KWQ	Nice app. Very less size. And works very smooth and perfectly well on my lg optimus one. Need update for some features.
3	B004L07KWQ	First, I would have rated 5 stars except for in thing. When the app is started you don't know it is running. it immediately opens to the drawing board.Other than that I really like the app. My kids will enjoy it. I will too. :-)
3	B004L07KWQ	Pretty awesome app, works great!Very simple, perfect for small kids just learning how to use technology. I got this simply because I look forward to playing with this with my 3 mo old when she gets a little older.Now to the obvious stuff. It's a paint program for kids. So when the app loads, as it says in description, it presents a blank black canvas. So when you see the banner and the screen goes blank, it's waiting for you to use it.Also as the description says, the back key works as an undo, so when you see this black canvas and freak out about the app not working and start mashing the back arrow (why would you hit the back arrow anyway?), it won't do anything, cuz you haven't drawn anything.Again, as the description says, when your ready to start over, shake the phone.Really getting tired of these boneheads giving bad reviews because they won't read an apps description before downloading it.
1	B004L07KWQ	There is a brief banner, then a blank, black screen. Doesn't Work on Droid X. Will uninstall. Very disappointed. Can't back out, have to hit the home button, at least it didn't lock up my phone.
3	B004L07KWQ	Basic fun doodling app.  Note:  SHAKE to clear all; back button to clear one stroke at a time.  There are similar apps out there with random brush styles as well as color, which I like, but this is good too.  The way in which you can change backgound color is cumbersome and a change in that process would make the app better.One thing I really like about this one is that you can give your phone to your kids to play with and, unless they push a menu button, they can't accidently add or delete something while they play.  The app takes the whole screen and a gives kids a blank slate while keeping my screens safe.  Droidx.
3	B004L07KWQ	At first, I thought that this app didn't have enough options, but then I realized that the simplicity was probably intentional as this is labeled for children.SHAKE TO CLEAR, although I didn't know that until I read the description in the app store.FUN TIP: if you use two fingers on the screen (like the pinching motion used for enlarging or shrinking the screen) keeping the fingers equidistant, move them as if tracing the outline of a circle.  You will get several lines overlapping each, creating a multicolored start burst effect.I also imported a picture of some plans for a cottage, and was able to draw some furniture in the plans, which was cool, although I couldn't shrink the picture on the screen to get the full layout (which was how I discovered the multicolored sunburst.)
3	B004L07KWQ	My daughter loves this - only wishes she could have a panel of stamps like in Gcompris paint - would make this even more awesome
3	B004L07KWQ	What I like the most about this app is that it is very simple (you get a blackboard soon as you start the app then you can start drawing whatever you want) and its so very fun and colorful. Great to entertain your kids or to write a colorful message and show to someone special :) I think it will work even better if you use a stylus so you can trace lines better. Definitely worth downloading it. On Oct 14, 2011 it was a free app of the day so even better :)
2	B004L07KWQ	just ok not something i would keep on my phone take up more space than i'd like. so i tried it and then got rid of it good thing i got it free
3	B004L07KWQ	Pretty cool. I think my kids will enjoy this. Kind of confusing after you open this, but the blank black screen is the app. Just start swiping around to draw. And to the dummies that are asking for a clear all button, did you even read the description? It says shake to erase all, and then it asks you confirm so you can't accidentally erase everything.Update: I showed this to my 8 year old and taught him how to take pictures to draw on them and he loved it. He loves taking a picture of his sister and drawing silly faces on her. And many thanks to the star-burst effect guy, I showed him that and he loved it.
3	B004L07KWQ	The dev has addressed most of the issues of the previous reviewers. There is now an easy way to clear the screen and exit the program. I'd like a way to be able to pick my own &quot;ink&quot; color.
3	B004L07KWQ	my little girl loved it! a very simple app that my 22 month old girl just loved! this will help when we're out running errands! great app!
3	B004L07KWQ	It's great to use.  You will like it, esp. if it is a free one.  Try it out when you get the chance.
1	B004L07KWQ	I have two vanilla Android 2.2 devices with 480x8** displays, multitouch, accelerometers, cameras, etc. and yet this app is only compatible with one of them?What gives?Let me guess, there's a &quot;tablet&quot; version I'm supposed to get for my 7&quot; even though it's spec'd like a phone and incapable of running Honeycomb apps.I would expect this kind of nonsense from the REAL Android Market (that didn't come preinstalled on my mini-tablet) but not from the alternative app store that's trying to gain popularity.5 stars less 3 for inserting false limitations to try and milk people for extra money.
2	B004L07KWQ	Could be so much better, but it still keeps the granddaughter's attention for a few minutes.  Would be nice if it had some settings to pick drawing tool and color.
3	B004L07KWQ	I've gotten this for my 7 yr old nephew. And he loves it. he is always drawing little ' game' maps and such. If you have or watch over a little one this is a nice prg to have.Ph: Optimus V
3	B004L07KWQ	This app is awesome for keeping kids entertained and quiet. Easy to use, it truly is ages 3 and up.
3	B004L07KWQ	first of all I want to say I got this app for about 2 months and its one of my son favorite. easy to use, nice and clean graphics,thanks.
3	B004L07KWQ	It's probably okay for babies, but my two-year old was looking for more options and got frustrated trying to figure out how to pick the colors he wanted to use.If you have a kid who is 2 1/2 or older, Kids Finger Paint by Cogito Games is probably a better option for them.  It is similar to this app but has a few more options.
3	B004L07KWQ	I'm pretty sure my four year old and I enjoy this app the same amount. There is something incredibly relaxing about swyping your fingers across the black canvas paper that your screen becomes and making even a simple drawing.I initially had the issue with the clear screen pop up other users are complaining of as well but rebooted and it seemed to resolve itself. I do wish as others have suggested that there was a way to lock this app as you can some other children apps because every time my daughter uses my phone to play she hands it back to me and is in a menu I didn't know existed.
3	B004L07KWQ	This is a good basic paint program that is entertaining for younger kids, slightly older kids would probably want something more sophisticated with more options.This is a good 10 minute time killer app for your kids at a restaurant or wherever you need to keep them occupied for a while. the shake to clear feature is one of the better design elements for kid use too.
3	B004L07KWQ	This app is simple.  It keeps my 3 year old's attention fairly well.  Shake to clear is good but I find you have to shake out a little too long. (I almost thought it didn't work  I have preferences and suggestions, but I'll refrain from rating based on those.  The app does what it says and my daughter thinks it's great  :)
3	B004L07KWQ	This app is one of the coolest free app of the day apps I've downloaded. The multi-touch function of it is completely amazing and allows for some really intense effects. I don't even have kids and I am definitely going to keep this installed and mess around with it regularly. It could do with an erase all button though.
2	B004L07KWQ	I'm not a stranger to kids painting apps and my kids seem to enjoy them.. my kids however always seem to hit the soft keys on my phone, and which boots them. they usually end up calling someone before they tell me that they lost the app.
3	B004L07KWQ	I don't have children and simply got this app for the entertainment. The touch paint progams typically irk me because they lag or are real shaky, but this one is pretty solid. I like keeping it on the various brushes setting and writing little honey-dos for my husband then sending them to his phone.Works great on Samsung Galaxy S.
3	B004L07KWQ	Its a cute app to have handy to draw things when you have to kill a few mins with a child that needs to sit still.  Better yet, we use it for writing spelling words in pretty colors to keep the childs attention and make the app semi educational.  Works every time, bec the child becomes engaged in not knowing what color will come out next.  It works flawlessly with no lag or problems, so its a keeper.
3	B004L07KWQ	At first I didn't get why you couldn't choose a color and why it chose it for you, but then I realized that this is something just for kids. Little ones, those who just want to see stuff appear on the screen but aren't so interested in having the correct color in places. Sure enough, when I let my nieces and nephews play with it they didn't want to put it down. If you have little kids, or are around them, then this app is certainly for you.
1	B004L07KWQ	do I want to clear screen? no. but it keeps asking me. I have to force close it. I have an EVO 4 g. kids would love it if it'd work correctly.
3	B004L07KWQ	We have two children, one a six year old and the other a three year old.  They both love this program.
3	B004L07KWQ	the free one was nice but the ads ruined it. glad this is free today and ad free. more apps for the young kids please.
1	B004L07KWQ	I got this for my three year old son because he loves to draw. It kept freezing on my kindle, and was hard to use. It shows stars on the app picture but I was unable to find any stars in the app.
3	B004L07KWQ	Okay people. Let's try to use some higher brain functions. This app is for the KIDS. My 2 year old is going to LOVE this app. The random colors are PERFECT for her. Some people have said that they get a banner &amp; then a black screen. Well I got the same thing. The black screen IS the drawing surface. Swipe your finger across it. This app works fine on my HTC Incredible running 2.2. To the guy, that complained about a child lock: try monitoring your kid with your phone. My daughter doesn't get more than 3-5 feet away from me when she has my phone just for the purpose of my being able to stop her from doing something that she's not supposed to. It's called parenting. To the guy that said that he doesn't have kids: who cares.  If the app doesn't apply to you, then don't even bother. In point of fact, yesterday's application was more female oriented. Being a man, I read the description, some reviews &amp; decided that it was not for me. I then backed out of the program &amp; went about my life. Does everybody have kids? No. Is everyone a female? Nope. Stop being selfish. Not every single application can apply to every single person. If you look back, most of the gaming apps that Amazon offers are focused toward men. Also, if the free app's description makes you wife cry that bad, maybe you should seek some counciling.
1	B004L07KWQ	I wouldn't pay .99 for this...does Amazon pay attention to what they post as their daily app ot do they draw it from the toilet?
3	B004L07KWQ	this is really a cool little app. nice for young kids, and even ones a little older. works great on acer 500 tablet. like another reviewer said, using multiple fingers creates fun effects.
3	B004L07KWQ	This app is soooo fun. My daughter absolutely loves it and it is fun for grown-ups too. lol  Got it on the kindle and when you are done with drawing a picture, you shake the kindle to erase and click ok. My daughter thinks that is so fun.  LOVE this!!
2	B004L07KWQ	A fun little app for kids,  as long as you don't try to change the background color. To cycle through the different background colors available you have to press menu and &quot;set color&quot; over and over again until you've found one you like. Want to go back to a color you liked? You have to start over. And once you clear the screen your back to the black background, so again, you have to start over if you want a different color.  This part should be much better implemented.
3	B004L07KWQ	Then I read some reviews & found that this app is actually quite good..No visible menu items (blank screen) is good feature for kids so that they don't accidently press exit, clear buttons etc.One option you/kids can play/enjoy is, keep your one finger on screen, move other finger (keep some distance between fingerS) on screen.. It will draw straight lines with differnt colors.. Or move both fingers in same direction to draw different colored parallel lines.. or move fingers in different direction (clockwise/anti clockwise).. (may be I don't know how to put this in words :))
3	B004L07KWQ	Very simple app, very simple controls, but fun to use.  I imagine kids would have a blast on this, with a tablet it is the modern etch-a-sketch.
1	B004L07KWQ	Won't install on my tablet because it doesn't have a camera? That's just a minor feature of this app, isn't it. Can't they just make the other features work on tablets?
3	B004L07KWQ	My girls call this "shake the screen" because they love drawing and then shaking the screen to clear it.  Its easy and entertaining for them and easy to use.  Every time you pick up your finger and draw something else, it changes the color you draw with, making for some interesting and colorful pictures.  If you put two fingers down at the same time, it makes some very colorful and amazing line art.  Just try it and see what you come up with!  You can save the pictures too, although we haven't used this because the kids would rather just "shake the screen" and move on to the new masterpiece.  You can also change the background color, but this is too difficult for them to do so they stay with the default black.  It would be nice for it to hold the background you choose after you shake the screen, so they don't have to go through the steps of choosing a new one, but then again, they don't care.It's not for someone who is trying to make the next Picasso, but entertaining none the less.
2	B004L07KWQ	could use selectable colors, hard to create a nice sunburst around a sun with so random colorization. multitouch should create independent lines. instead of point to point straight lines. shake to clear is cool, very etchasketch.
2	B004L07KWQ	This app is not ready for prime time, and should be free until basic and critical features are included.  Brush size, brush color, background color and perhaps brush transparency are included in any decent children's painting app.  Inability to clear the canvas and start new is irritating. Add these features and I'd gladly hand over my dollar.
3	B004L07KWQ	My 3 y.o. enjoys playing with this and the ability to save and share the photos online is a nice extra. The pictures it makes are aesthetically very pleasing.
3	B004L07KWQ	Dear Amazon, how dare you remember people that there are kids in the world? that is so inconsiderate! I say We should also give one star to the public schools and kindergartens because they are also inconsiderate providing education to kids, don't they know that there are people that will get offended if they see kids. Gap should also get rid of the baby gap! (can you see the sarcasm? c'mon people, grow up)
3	B004L07KWQ	THis is a great app for kids 18 months and up. The varieties color and shapes are only limited by the childs imagination
3	B004L07KWQ	Getting fluorescent colors on sketches can be art, and this app does just that. Not a serious app at all, but a fun one (for kids). Does what it says, and does it decently.
3	B004L07KWQ	I'm not saying that is a bad thing, it lives up to it's title.  I think would be great for younger children that don't always get wrapped up in the features or color selection but just want to have some fun.  Can take a picture of dog and then draw faces on him.  :-  What is wrong with that?  if your looking for a complex drawing tool, this isn't your app.  With a app name of &quot;Kids paint&quot;, I'd hope you'd pick up on that.
3	B004L07KWQ	Just what I was hoping for from the description. A silly, lighthearted finger painting program where you can dress up your photos or just good off.Plus, no questionable permissions.
3	B004L07KWQ	Thank you, Amazon, for giving parents something worthwhile to share with our kids! This is better than a game for entertaining and playing with a young child. Our baby boy is almost at the age where he can make associations of cause and effect and this simple app is immensely helpful and stimulating for him.The uncluttered screen makes it easy to use for toddlers who may not have the best coordination yet. The bright colors and bold lines give instant gratification and attract attention.For those without kids, it might make an interesting diversion, but this is not Photoshop or a pro painting tool. There have been plenty of free Amazon apps featuring intense gaming action, camera tools, and productivity and lifestyle tools, it's refreshing to see something simple and useful that parents and babies will love!Given the immature nature of many of the complaints and negative reviews, I'm surprised those "babies" didn't find it entertaining. Perhaps when they are out of their "terrible twos" mental stage they will enjoy it more.
3	B004L07KWQ	Ok people stop the dumb feedback lol shake to clear the damm screen, don't exit the game, don't hit the back button over and over... Oh and don't download if you dont/can't have kids LOL!!!
3	B004L07KWQ	(My Touch 4g)Pro: My kids live this app.  Multi touch to create straight lines, choose gradient background colors, pick a photo as background or take a picture to use a background.  Physical keys on the phone are shortcuts for background color, undo, menu,  and choose a background pic.Con: needs a child lock to prevent kids from saving pictures, sharing pictures via email or social sites, etc...*To those who complain about a price being displayed on the buy button of the free app of the day:  It won't charge you!  It takes time for the site to update with the new button.  I have pushed the button like this all the time.  It does not charge.  If you don't trust it, just wait to get the app later in the day!*
3	B004L07KWQ	Ok seriously, I'm 45 and even I have had fun with it. Will I use it all the time? Maybe not. Kind of neat as a note taker since you can take a photo of the screen. I know there are other apps for that but none as colorful :) And I can definitely see the potential to keep a little one busy for a while.
1	B004L07KWQ	You really can't set or even lock the brush size and color? Would rate as 3 with color/brush settings and 4 with a fill tool.
3	B004L07KWQ	You can't get more simple than this yet have surprisingly great results. The change of colors with each stroke makes every scribble look like art. My neice will love this.
3	B004L07KWQ	I don't have any ads on my version for some reason, so I don't see any half naked ladies in the app...The app is simple and works perfectly for me  HTC Incredible 2). I'm not a kid, but I guess I have the heart of a kid because this is pretty awesome to me at least. Doesn't need complicated features like others are suggesting, keep it nice and simple.
3	B004L07KWQ	While it's fun to play around with for a few minutes for adults, this program is amazing for young kids. The simplicity would probably make it less interesting for anyone over 5 years old, but my 2-year-old loves to draw on this.My favorite feature of the program is the ability to take a picture of what your kid drew. Those make for great wallpapers/screensavers and they're great to show off your kids budding talent. :)The program has no problems at all on my Samsung Galaxy Spica.
2	B004L07KWQ	I've been looking for an app like this. I knew my son would love this. One glaring issue though - you can't erase anything you draw. At least, I don't see an option to. You have to completely exit and restart the program. 5 stars if they fix that.
3	B004L07KWQ	Got this today, while it's free. This isn't something I'd pay for, though. It's pretty cute. You don't have to exit out like someone else said to get a new screen. If you press/hold the back arrow/key it will undo every stroke you made until you're back at the beginning. I like the multiple colors, and that you can color on pictures you've already taken. My nephew will find it silly, I'm sure.. Since I colored all over him! The screen was black for me as well when I started it, so I thought it wasn't going to work.. But that was just the background color it started me with. All the other comments kind of had me worried when I saw it!
1	B004L07KWQ	It wasn't very creative .I was very plain . There wasn't very much to play or do.That is why I do not like this game.
1	B004L07KWQ	Not worth $1. The Application is fun and entertaining for very, very young kids, however due to its simplicity of having zero options I say this seems to be a free app that someone put a price tag on.  This paid version should allow for more options. Suggested options: Rainbow Effect (Removes random colors and follows a rainbows color spectrum), Primary only (just the colors red, blue and yellow), and finally a Color wheel (pick the color). Leave the random brush sizes but the &quot;random colors only&quot; option is starting to annoy even my 5 &amp; 7 year old daughters.
3	B004L07KWQ	I've had the free version for a while now &amp; my kids love it! So glad to see it as the FAOD.
3	B004L07KWQ	This little program is great for what it is. Even as an adult, just fun to make drawings, be creative. If you aren't in the mood to think about selecting tools, colors, etc, you want this.
3	B004L07KWQ	Very nice simple app, can't choose colors to draw in but kids don't seem to mind this. Cannot accidentally erase without hitting the ok button.
3	B004L07KWQ	This is a great app to occupy a kid during dinner. Or a drive.  Or when ever you need a break!
3	B004L07KWQ	My kids love this app we play tic-tac-toe on it and draw  for a long time . it's perfect for a time killer.
1	B004L07KWQ	I can't get past the prompt &quot;clear screen?&quot;. I even unistalled and reinstalled, to no avail. The app doesn't work. Fix the bug please.
3	B004L07KWQ	This app is fun, its not something thas going to take up days and days, but it will occupy you when you are bored and is great for kids. I use it on a phone, but assume on a tablet its much better simply due to screen size. its simple and works. Pressing the back button to erase lines is easy and not a hassle. I suppose a &quot;clear all&quot; button would help, but, its not really a big deal.
3	B004L07KWQ	not autocad of course but fast open, easy on battery, easy save/share/exit.Easy shapes would be nice, plus undo, pen size, color chooser, etc ...BUT the more features, the more resources, which would arguably defeat purpose of quick paint program. I think it's a keeper.
3	B004L07KWQ	Downloaded it onto my Droid! Great app to kill time for my son,but really wish it was available for my rooted NookColor ;-(But as always I do love my free amazon apps of the day!! Thank you!!
3	B004L07KWQ	a goofy doodling program for someone much to young to own the device it runs on ;) worth the price I say.
1	B004L07KWQ	Multi touch only makes lines, and makes multipal lines to quickly.  No 'clear all' option, you have to hit the back button over and over until clear.  Cant pick background color or change the color of paint in general. There are better paint programs that support true Multi Touch with color options and they are FREE.  HTC Thunderbolt
3	B004L0NGEC	This is great app! I have a Kindle Fire and i can see all of my Picassa Photos---they look awesome on the device and i can share them or save them from the App. Perfect!
3	B004L0NGEC	Overall a very nice app that does what it was designed to do. My only complaint is that the slideshow transitions seem to fast and abrupt. These should be made slower and smoother. Better yet... make them user adjustable.
3	B004L0NGEC	this app does exactly what it says it does.  I am very satisfied with my purchase.  Recommend to any Google User who uses Google photos. (such as picasa or google plus) .
3	B004L0NGEC	Nice app to use for getting picasa on kindle fire hd. the picasa app is for google but it works good for amazon.
3	B004L0NGEC	I've got Picasa on my PC and was happy to find it on Amazon as well.  There are some gorgeous photographs on here!
3	B004L0NGEC	this app connects with all of the picasa albums that you have uploaded and you have them now on your Kindle fire. Great app!
3	B004L0NGEC	This is a must buy app if you use Picasa. I also use it for presentations since it displays jpg well. Just convert powerpoint slides to jobs.
3	B004L0NGEC	Works great on the Kindle Fire no need to havegigabytes of photos on the Kindle Fire you could upload themto your Web album and display them on the Kindle,you could evenplay them in slideshow mode, or one at a time.
3	B004L0NGEC	Helpful app for our recent vacation in Colorado. Learning curve very tolerable. I have not used it enough to know everything it can do but it is very helpful for uploading albums.
3	B004L0NGEC	I love this application, it allows me to watch all my pictures and most importantly my videos. This is the only app that supports video.
3	B004L0NGEC	It's nice to have access to all my pics on the cloud on my Kindle.  Great subject matter for my art.
3	B004L0NGEC	This app quickly and simply downloads all your Picasa albums to your Kindle.I didn't want more than that.  It works.  Thank you.
2	B004L0NGEC	I can't really say too much about this app since I'm still learning, that's why I say it's OK for now.
3	B004L0NGEC	I was very upset fo find out that a photo  I had taken of my driver's license was automatically uploaded to a public album by my phone's resident app.  When resolving this problem, I also discovered that this resident app did not have options - it was all to a public album or no upload at all.  That scary experience lead me to this little app which I absolutely love!PicFolio lets you select which pictures to upload to which albums, who gets to see them, as well as comment on the pictures before uploading.  You can then free up the space on your phone for more photos and still be able to view them all.  You can also use this app to download your photos back onto your phone, if you want.I use this app all the time and love it!
3	B004L0NGEC	This is a great app for anyone that uses Picasa/Google+ Photos. If you edit a photo on your computer it automatically syncs. Just need to remember to have Kindle plugged in while it syncs. My only complaint is I can't send the picture straight from the app to a photo editing app without first downloading it.  I have too many photos to store on my Kindle. I need to use another online app, similar to pFolio, to send directly to an editing app. That is the reason I gave it four stars rather than five. If you you are only all you are looking for is access to your Google+ Photos, it is great.
3	B004L0NGEC	While I am baffled at Google's exclusion of Picasa Web Albums integration in the stock Gallery app, PicFolio meets the need well. The interface is clean and responsive on a MyTouch 4g.The one missing feature is the ability to store login credentials for more than one Google account. Without this feature, there's no quick way to switch between Google accounts, except to manually enter the credentials every time you want to switch between accounts.
3	B004L0NGEC	I do wish I could figure out how to move albums around.  We are putting our slides on the computer.
3	B004L0NGEC	This app is great.  Can have all my pictures in one place.  Very easy to use.  Photos can up set to upload automatically or manually. Q
3	B004L0NGEC	Works great with my laptop. Easy to send photos almost anywhere. I have my photos on every device in the house.
3	B004L0NGEC	I use this to share photos between my wife and my two computers and two tablets. I first set up my folders on a computer and then uploaded the pics to the Picasa web page /album. Our Kindle Fire 's display the pica real nice. I use the Picasso tools to crop and fix photo 's prior to uploading. Then we just hit refresh on the Fire and the pica are ready to display.
1	B004L0NGEC	Awful,  contacted customer service over 2 weeks ago and still no response. Will not work on my kindle Fire.Gave 1 starbecause I had to.
3	B004L0NGEC	I love this app...  I have always been a fan of Picasa, and although this app is not a product of Google, I still consider it to be a very good extension of the Picasa software.  Thanks!!!!
3	B004L0NGEC	Without this app getting to your Picasa albums is a challenge.  This app simplifies the process and makes showing off your pictures a breeze.
3	B004L0NGEC	I use Picard to import, catalogue and archive old family photo albums, Videos and current pictures. Having it available on Kindle is great. The screen is the perfect size to show off pictures to friends and family.
3	B004L0NGEC	I like this app, I would recommend it to anyone that wants to have their photos on line. I use it all the time.
3	B004L0NGEC	I am a Fine Art Artist and Natural Lifestyle Photographer and the main reason I purchased my Kindle Fire HDX was so I could have all my work at my fingertips and ready to show clients and perspective clients.Unable to download my all-time favorite simple edit program Picasa 3, I became discouraged until I asked in the Kindle forums if there was any thing like Picasa that I could get to amass my photography and art on my kindle.So far it has been quite satisfying to see all my work at my fingertips but I have also found the pFolio is not an edit program, guess I didn't read all the info... now on the hunt for an edit program.
3	B004L0NGEC	couldn't find this at first. Couldn't figure out how ti show pics. Love this.. I'm a grandma AND a photographer
3	B004L0NGEC	The stock "Gallery" app that comes with the Kindle Fire is pretty usless for photos.  Slow, unresponsive, unable to caption pics, and worst of all, it won't present photos in full screen.  PicFolio is a good alternative.  My only reservation is that the connection to the web is sometimes slow.If you're frustrated with how the Fire's Gallery app works with photos, try this.
3	B004L0NGEC	I just love it. I have 300+ albums in Picasa and Picfolio works awesome! One of my favorite apps. Fast and easy to use.
2	B004L13LZU	lots of inspiring quotes here helped give me a daily boost as well as my friends when i would post it on f.b
3	B004L13LZU	I really like these quotes. It just gives you something to read. Something that you might really like. It's okay for kids but they might get bored with it.
3	B004L13LZU	This app is honestly very very good. The only problem I have is the bigger words and they have hard to understand meaning or purpose.
2	B004L13LZU	I thought it would be something different other people might like it too me it was just okay liked some.
3	B004L13LZU	This app has taught me so many things. I can also give good advice to my friends. I promise that this app will make you feel relaxed, calm and will teach you to be a better person.
3	B004L13LZU	Nice quotes from famous authors, thinkers and celebrities. If you don't know what to say, just click on this and something positive and uplifting will show up.
3	B004L13LZU	I have always enjoyed reading quotes from notable people. I like that I can mark a quote as a favorite, and that there seems to be an unending supply.
3	B004L13LZU	I like inspiring quotes, so really hit home, so I would say get it if you like this kind of thing.
3	B004L13LZU	Love these inspiring quotes because they really seem to hit the nail on the head on those days where I'm a tad down.  Then along came these quotes and I'm back up to where I want to be for the day.  I don't always agree with the sentiments of some of the authors but the thoughts are well worth reading.  Thanks Amazon!
3	B004L13LZU	Nice to have this app when you need a bit of a mood lifter.  I have used this app many times when I needed an attitude adjustment and a bit of a pat on the back.  instant gratification.
3	B004L13LZU	I like to read this when I get to work, before starting my day.  I share with my coworkers. I like it better then the daily reflection from work!
3	B004L13LZU	Just like the title says, all the quotes truly are inspiring. I loveCollectected groups of quotes because you can learn alot from them. SometimesSecond-hand knowledge can be just as good as experience ;)
2	B004L13LZU	I didn't find the quotes very inspiring, but everything worked. It maybe great for others but I thought it was a little more to the app, that's all.
3	B004L13LZU	The pages have beautiful scenery and very thoughtful quotes. You can add favorites and go through the pages. I like it for the inspiration and scenery. Good application!
3	B004L1EGL8	After doing a thorough review of tablets, i determined that a Kindle would suit my needs at an excellent price IF i could side load some other apps that weren't yet supported by Kindle.  This file manager was necessary to meet that goal and works exactly as it should, making the Kindle a terrific tablet for my requirements.
1	B004L1EGL8	havent been able to figure it out to deal with it. I some how managed to get some music in a folder and some kid apps but I couldnt tell you how I did it.
2	B004L1EGL8	good app for the filing of things, keep things organized and in check, no more ever loosing of important items
3	B004L1EGL8	My son in law thought I needed this download to make my books show up on my Kindle HD device.
3	B004L1EGL8	This was a FAOTD for me, but I would pay the normal fee for it.I originally got this because I found a way to use the camera on my Kindle Fire HD to take snapshots like a normal camera and part of that was to use this file system. It worked flawlessly for me.Just recently I wanted to start watching movies from my Kindle on my large flat panel. I found out that Kindle isn't able to view/stream flash video(FLV - which is very common on most sites), but discovered that if I download a movie to my pc and then convert that to H264 (on a free program), that I'm now able to transfer the file from pc to kindle and can watch them on my big screen. This file system does the the job very easily.There are 4 stars on the review only because of the lack of instructions and not because it doesn't work correctly. Good app.
1	B004L1EGL8	The app confuses me.  I dont know what it is supposed to do.  Someone from my local library was loading Zinio for me and said I need this first.  I have it on my Kindle, but I don't have a clue how I'm supposed to use it.
1	B004L1EGL8	Descent file manager wish it went more in depth! Don 't know what else to say other than it does what it says.
3	B004L1EGL8	I like the concept of this app. I didn't give it a higher rating because I've haven't actually used the app yet but plan on doing so. I am just happy that it is available.
2	B004L1EGL8	I dont understand how to run this app it doesnt make sense.  Its supposed to help you download maps and stuff on Minecraft Pocket Edition. I dont understand how to use it so thats why three stars.
3	B004L1EGL8	I like it. Simple and useful file management for those who need more control of their Android OS.  Perhaps not as good as ES, but I haven't run into limitations.  Solid, easy interface.
3	B004L1EGL8	First of all, the people complaining about the camera, Amazon updated it so you can us  it now, second of all, all you needed to do before the update is to download PicShop Lite. This app is great, I moved my downloaded documents to the correct folder so I could find it, and I used it to download third party/sideloaded apps.
3	B004L1EGL8	I downloaded this app looking for something similar to the Astro file manager for Android. This app allows me to do the same things on kindle.
3	B004L1EGL8	Used this program on my phone and found it to be helpful.  Put it on my kindle fire for the same reason.  Good program.
3	B004L1EGL8	Haven't had it long, but so far it's worked perfectly and been a great help, especially for transferred music files that the Nexus interface does seem to see (although they play when found).  This app fills a difficult gap in the Android system, that doesn't let you into it very easily.
3	B004L1EGL8	Great file manager the second best manager for files out there . I would recommend to anyone who wants to clear files and discover new files that they never had before.
2	B004L1EGL8	Can this work to download texture packs or skins in minecraft pe for kindle fire.I want to know before I get.Please have info!Would be great!:)
3	B004L1EGL8	easy to use, keeps things uncluttered, put it on when I first set up tablet and I like to keep things organized, I know where to find things.
2	B004L1EGL8	There has been things I downloaded and couldn't find on my kindle fire hdx. Now I can find and delete or install them with no problem. I like it :)
2	B004L1EGL8	It didn't see where my apps were. I ended up getting an app manager instead. I still left it on my tablet in case a need for it arises later.
3	B004L1EGL8	I needed to see the files on my Android and this worked brilliantly! It was intuitive & easy to use!
2	B004L1EGL8	I uninstalled this app - it worked just fine but I found something that I liked a little better for what I needed.
3	B004L1EGL8	This app installed quickly and is both easy and intuitive to use. If you can use Windows Explorer then this will seem very familiar.I love the simplicity. There are no special settings and it comes immediately up showing you the file system of your phone or tablet. Here is where the advice comes in. It's easy to navigate and to also open and modify folders and folders. Press down on a folder and you get a pop-up that allows you to either move, rename or delete it. Do the same on an individual file and your choices are send, move, copy, rename and delete. You can also create a new folder. Powerful stuff, but if you are not familiar with your file system you could do serious damage. Therein lies the caveat: if you are a novice I advise that you not do anything other than explore with this app.You can always get to your root by touching the 'Home' icon on the screen. When you navigate down your directory tree there will be a path at the bottom of the screen. For example if I am in the Albums folder of my extSdCard I will see: Home|Storage|extSdCard|Albums. In other words it's difficult to lost your way as long as you pay attention to the visual clues.My main use is to work around a huge flaw in Amazon's MP3 Cloud Player. It stores all of my downloaded music on my phone's internal storage (I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note II). There is no workaround, so Amazon's buggy app will quickly fill up the 16GB internal storage, ignoring the fact that I also have a 64GB external SD card. I use this app to move my music to the external card. In that respect even if this were not a free app it has a lot of value to me. Combine the zero cost with the fact that I have yet to discover any bugs and you can understand why I rated it as five stars.
3	B004L1EGL8	App does what it says it will do and that is to allow you to manage your files stored on your phone or app,
3	B004L1EGL8	My AV receiver, bluray player, and Cable company had apps to expand and enhance their capabilities using a tablet or smartphone. They were not on the Kindle store, so I needed a way to download them from 1Mobile Market.  This app was free and works perfectly for all my needs.  Shows all my folders in an alphabetical and easy to access location.  Definitely recommend.
3	B004L1EGL8	This is a great product. I love that I can easily to manuer round in it andEasy to use.
2	B004L1EGL8	I used it but then used another peogram that did the same thing, but from another source, its still loaded, but not used
3	B004L1EGL8	This app does exactly what I need it to do. And the way it's user interface is set up makes sense. Simple forward and backward browsing of your files and folders. Oh yay it's free. Way to go.
3	B004L1EGL8	This works great with my Kindle.  I didn't put it on myself, my roommate found it and installed it for me.  Works great
3	B004L1EGL8	This is a great app for use on a Kindle Fire.  I downloaded this the other day through the Kindle Fire because I wanted to look at the folder structure as well as add some photos in "private" albums without everyone else being able to see them when showing the devise off to others.Installing this app was easy & quick...no issues. And figuring out how to use the app took all of 2 seconds.  If you have a Android Phone and are familiar with Astro for it installing this app will be a snap.
1	B004L1EGL8	While this is great tool for side loading apps. It lacks some features. No delete feature that I could find being the biggest issue.
3	B004L1EGL8	I have used this app and am quite impressed with it.  It is much better than the inherent one that was provided.
3	B004L1EGL8	I was looking for a simple way to manage files on my Kindle and this app does a wonderful job. Easy to use and intuitive.
3	B004L1EGL8	This is a simple but needed app.  It works well and helps you find files when you need them.  I found this app easier to use than other similar ones.I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes.  I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.
3	B004L1EGL8	this was good.  I liked it so much that i decided to purchase the regular one.  What a great little tool this is.
3	B004L1EGL8	File Manager Free is not only a great file manager but necessary to run Google Chrome as an actual browser on your Kindle Fire HD. I wrote out how to install Chrome on the Kindle Fire HD in the comments section of the Chrome App here on Amazon. A lot of people are having problems running Chrome. That's because you have to have this file manager to run it, ES will not work for Chrome.
1	B004L1EGL8	I has some cool features but the UI could really be improve, in that field ES File Explorer is much better
3	B004L1EGL8	Needs a search function when looking for a specific file. More intuitive than ES. Has larger print and icons for old fingers and eyes.
3	B004L1EGL8	Seems a fairly well organized thing...You have to dabble with it for some time before you understand it...Try it.
3	B004L1EGL8	I's ok but i like es-3 better. Es-3 is more intuitive.They both do the job and they are both free.
2	B004L1EGL8	The cell service wanted me to pay more for the service on the  phone I wanted so they would allow me to use a phone with great limitations in hopes I would upgrade and I chose to leave!
1	B004L1G7K6	This is a very inappropriate app...the first word is sex -related, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YPU ARE OVER 18!!!!!!
3	B004L1G7K6	being from england, i was curious as to how some words were translated - well, you guys got it all - nice job.
1	B004L1G7K6	I am a Londoner living in USA for 30 years, nothing new, don't waste your time, at least it was free! Wanted something much more hip and up to date. Slang in the UK has changed, not reflected here.
1	B004L1G7K6	I love me some British slang. You got a problem with that or summat like that? This app isn't that great. Not enough words. Way too repetitive. Skip it.
2	B004L1G7K6	There are better ways to spend your money.Cut at first, but not much to keep you entertained.There it is.
1	B004L1G7K6	Focused primarily on sexual functions and private body parts.  I deleted this app within minutes of installing it.  Very disappointing and especially inappropriate for children.
3	B004L1G7K6	I added this to my 11 year old's Fire since she loves to pretend to speak British. I read it before she got it, and it is a good thing I did. There are many inappropriate slang words that I don't want my child to see. I wish there was a 'clean' version of this. Needless to say, I deleted the app before she opened the Fire. I personally love it for adults!
1	B004L1G7K6	seriously useless.  Don't expect to use this to start a conversation with a Brit.  I have removed this app from my kindle.
1	B004L1G7K6	It's not what I thought it would be. Too limited and you can't due a word search. Better to look up in internet.
3	B004L1G7K6	An amusing little app, which just might help you understand a thing or two those crazy Brits say.  All in good fun now, chap. Now be a good mate, load this up, sod off and have a few laughs. Cheers!
1	B004L1G7K6	Most of the words are either sex drug  or alcohol relatedSure that the British talk about more than that. Could have been interesting but isn't.
1	B004L1G7K6	I am too young to look at this! who would waste their very own time to make an innappropriate crap that NOBODY needs to see at all. I would not recommend this for anybody - even if you are an adult -. I think that the person who made this should have worked harder on this app. Plus, I think it could have been a lot better. This app needs SERIOUS help.
1	B004L1G7K6	this is a very bad app it has much inappropriate words on it I thought it would be fun but its bad don't ever get this game
3	B004L1G7K6	there is some really really really really inappropriate stuff in there wally inappropriate stuff. works great on kindle fire but I would only get it if u are older than sixteen or seventeen.
1	B004L1G7K6	Inappropriate for anyone. Using these words are just saying inappropriate words in &quot;code&quot;. It often repeats itself, and gets old very fast. I would not recommend this app.
3	B004L1G7K6	if It wasn't so inappropriate, id toataly give it 5 stars. its completely funny eventhough it has some sexual terms. honestly id keep it on my kindle fire if I wouldn't get in trouble for it. a good use for this app is so u can say dirty things out loud and no body will have the slightest thing your saying ;D haha. if u are atleast 13, u should get this app.
1	B004L1G7K6	To get this out of the way, I don't mind sexual, drug, etc. references. I've heard most of them and they don't shock me. If you're upset about these words, let me ask you what you expect to see in a list of slang words. Also, please, always check an app *before* you put it on someone's tablet or phone, child or not. If you didn't look at it first, stop whining. So no, that's not why I dislike this app.My first issue is with the intrusiveness of the ads. They are too big and sit smack in the middle of the page. Second, I get a word - one word - on the screen. That's all. And when I click on the word, I'm sent to an external web browser. Huh? If you want to go in that direction, build a freaking website, not an Android app.What a shame. This app could have been so much better with more thought and work.
1	B004L1G7K6	Contains bad swear words so not for kids and though some words are still used today many are outdated and not used in polite society or in front of most parents as an adult humour novelty app its ok but cant be used to translate anything.
3	B004L1G7K6	This app is fun - learn new words and try using them in every day situations. Layout is simple, which works perfectly
3	B004L1G7K6	As a BBC tv show/movie addict, I liked learning the meaning of some words I've often heard. You can guess before revealing the answer.
3	B004L1G7K6	...a good time learning British slang. Some words I knew already. But, there were a lot more that I was toally unfamiliar with. I do not regret adding this to my apps.
1	B004L1G7K6	I am quite sure that there are way more British slang words than what is portrayed here. It was kinda corny
1	B004L1G7K6	I thought this might be funny, but it was totally lame and not at all funny or educational in learning new words.
3	B004L1G7K6	this app was tried out and deemed not suitable for my tablet as there were other better ones that i am currently using.  took it off my tablet.  actually don't speak british english that much.
1	B004L1G7K6	I downloaded this thinking I would impress my husband who attended British schools for quite some time and is familiar with the Bristish slang.  Most of the words are nothing but profanity.  Seriously, I could care less what the British Slang for the Male genitalia is or the female for that and I certainly don't plan to discuss with anyone from Britian what comes out of it.  Not only that, I am quite certain these terms are from ages ago.  My husband and I watch a British show called Are You Being Served and most of these words can be found on that show.  I am sure British slang, like American slang changes from time to time.
1	B004L1G7K6	it just tells you a British term and you click on the button and it tells you what it means. plus very innapopriate.
1	B004L1G7K6	There are so many slang words that are so cute, so why did the devs use sexual and drug based ones?  An lot of these definitions are not only dead wrong, but they haven't been used since my gaffer was a lad.
1	B004L1G7T2	I can't even answer the flipping question!All I can do is press show answer don't get this on the kindle fire and it won't let you make new cards on this! I don't see how anyone likes this...if no stars was an option I would put that!
1	B004L1G7T2	still does not work on Kindle  Fire can not down load other decks graphics are often hard to read. can only get sample file
3	B004L1G7T2	If you are learning anything, flashcards are indispensable.  This app make creation and review a snap.  My wife and I are learning Spanish.  Their are hundreds (maybe thousands) of Spanish-English flashcards on line which can easily be downloaded for review off line with this app.  Of course you can easily made or import your own. I like this app because once you sync with your online card sets, you can go offline to review and study.  So, you can take your Kindle and go to a park and sit under a tree and review your flashcards.  It is great.
1	B004L1G7T2	Can't get it to sync my deck. I love AnkiDroid on my cell phone, but downloaded from the Play store. I don't know what's wrong with the Amazon App store version on Kindle Fire, but it doesn't work properly for personal decks. It does say that the sync feature is full of bugs and to backup often. Hope this gets worked out. Amazon App Store has been the biggest disappointment for the Kindle Fire. Sad...
1	B004L1G7T2	I am a fan of Anki on other machines, but I could not get anything to work here on the Kindle Fire HD.
3	B004L1G7T2	Easy to use, customizable flash cards with a sizable community of shareable decks so you don't have to first spend hours making your own decks before you can start using the program.  Flash card decks can include text, photos, videos, etc.
2	B004L1G7T2	This is an extremely useful app for studying, especially foreign languages. However, it doesn't work well on the Kindle Fire. I've used Anki on PC and a Google Nexus tablet, and on those, it worked wonderfully. I really hope someone is working on getting it to work better on Kindle Fire.  If I can't create or edit decks, there's really no point in having the app. For now, it's uninstalled on my Kindle, but I continue to use it on other devices.
3	B004L1I3FI	I've been using PDA/Phone wallet programs for a few years.  (First with Windows Mobile, and now with Android.)I Like to keep my personal and financial information and various web/net passwords saved in a single and secure program which syncs between my PC and my EVO 4G.SafeWallet works great!  I had been using another company's product, but since they haven't produced an Android version, I needed a solution.  SafeWallet was able to "read" my other wallet file--I still needed my password for the wallet for this to be possible--and this allowed for a painless migration.  The additional option of DropBox sync really makes it convenient!
3	B004L1I3FI	Because I can use it on my Android phone and Windows laptop, and the fact that I can sync with Dropbox, thus allowing my devices to stay in sync, this is the perfect wallet for me.  I've used it for years, and when they were one of the first to add Android support of the wallets I had experience with, I chose this product.  It does exactly what I need it to do, and I'm completely satisfied with it.
1	B004L1I3FI	I picked up SafeWallet for two reasons.  First was that I needed a solution that allowed for use on Blackberry, Android, and Windows.  Second is that I wanted something that was competent and had a good UI.  On paper, SafeWallet is supposed to fill both of these requirements.  It probably does, once you get it working.It's not working for me.  In fact, anyone with a Kindle Fire using the Amazon store version of SafeWallet also know it's not working for them.  Because of an error on the software developer's side a fatal error was introduced in the 1.1.9 version.  The figured it out and several days later, after they were notified  by users, they fixed the problem.Cool, right?  Yes, if you use the Android Marketplace.  No, if you use Amazon.  Kindle Fire doesn't use Android Marketplace.  See where I'm going?  I've been well into a week with this problem.  The developer insists they are doing what they can, but that the problem is on Amazon's side.  I haven't heard anything back yet from my favorite company, so who knows what's going on really...Is this an indictment on SBSH SafeWallet?  Yes.  A fatal error should not go out in any release.  Quality control?  And having the users alert you to the problem?  That shouldn't happen either.  I'm pretty dissappointed with Amazon as well.Once I get this product working, I'm sure it will be just fine and I suspect the product will work as claimed.  But I've already started my backup plan for moving data out of SafeWallet and into KeePass should this happen again.
2	B004L1I3FI	Review Update 12/1/2011Reducing rating from 4 stars to 3.Have found an additional, major annoyance - when attempting to copy passwords the app will copy the value from the adjacent field, whatever that value is, instead of copying the password. It took a couple of times of having an account locked for submitting the wrong password to force me to figure it out. Turns out that for some (but not all) password records the app would copy the field value from the field just before my password. It happens on records where I've added custom fields, and it only happens on the Android version of the app. I'm using the app on a Kindle Fire, so that may be part of the problem too.Seems the developer maintains an active presence on Facebook. I'll try to find a solution through that venue and will update this review with the success or lack thereof.-----------------------------------------------------------------I began using this app on my Blackberry Bold, then found the PC companion software. It made it very easy to manage my passwords on my PC and synch them to my BB phone. Safewallet for Android also allows you to easily synch between PC application and Android device. While this app works very well as a stand-alone product, the ability to manage passwords from your PC and distribute the most up-to-date version to multiple platforms is a terrific benefit, and is, in my mind, what sets this product apart from other password management tools.Pros -You can create password records for different types of uses - credit cards, web sites, personal documents like Passport, Driver's License, etc.The app gives you a lot of fields to build a password record, plus the ability to add more.You can enter your own password, or let the app generate one for you.It's quite easy to copy the PW from SafeWallet and paste it into the appropriate field in the target app.Amazingly simple and easy to synch between the desktop app and the Android app. You're offered the choice between USB or WiFi. I tried USB at first, and even though the app reported success, it did'nt create my wallet. I tried WiFi, and my PC wallet was successfully transferred to my Android tablet. Think it's very possible it was user error that caused the USB synch to fail, and not due to software issues.Update process has been good. SBSH has been good about announcing updates and making them available to registered users.Cons -There are a couple of bugs I've found in the Android app that cause it to crash. Looking at the Safewallet Desktop Companion page under Settings causes it to stop, and it does it consistently. How annoying is it that a fatal crash happens in SETTINGS? You'd expect that section of code to be stable as a rock. Had one other crash, but wasn't able to make it happen a second time.The biggest drawback to this app is the manufacturer's support. They make it very difficult to find any information on their web site, and are WAY less than good about supporting their apps or responding to questions. My attempts to get support or information were met with silence. These folks really need to work on supporting their product better. I would have rated 5 stars, but dinged the app a star for POOR manufacturer support. It's a good app, and a good suite of apps, but buyer beware if you run into problems you likely won't get much help from the developer.
3	B004L1I3FI	I purchased this password sotrage manager for my Kindle Fire, I liked the way it looked and it is quick and easy to store your passwords so noone  can access them. The manager is protected by a master password that should be different than any of your others but something you will never forget. I was pleasantly surprised that there is also a program you can but to add this to your PC, laptop or any other device. It is an additional cost, but worth it to me. As you are on the internet and going into any of your accounts it asks you if you would like to store the password. Less work than entering them all separetly. It also keeps the sites URL.
3	B004L1I3FI	This is a great app for Android!  Take it from me, someone that has literally hundreds of complex & not so complex passwords, this app keeps track of all of them and it is easy to add more as the user interface is a snap to understand.Another nice thing about the app is you can back up all of your work to either the cloud, local pc or both so in the event your phone gets lost, stolen or you get a new one, restoring your passwords is easy.
1	B004L1I3LW	I'm not a knowledge buff so this kind of stuff doesn't stick with.  I didn't find it interesting enough to read very far, I didn't share it with anyone
3	B004L1I3LW	I thought this might be kinda stupid app. I was wrong. It really has a vast amount of amazing facts about the human body.
2	B004L1I3LW	I mean the facts are awesome, but some of it I already know about and the color background was a bit hard to &#34;digest&#34; the information in. And I mean for real because it is so COLORFUL to the point where I have to look around for the fact even though it is located at the same place.
3	B004L1I3LW	I enjoyed this product. I would recommend it it to someone interested in facts about the body. Makes you aware of various features of the body.
2	B004L1I3LW	this app is ok but nothing to write home about. it is kind of fun but not that great of a review tool which is what I wanted
1	B004L1I3LW	**WARNING: This app &amp; the following review contain strong sexual content.**!! On the 2nd random fact page it explained how certain foods alter the TASTE of semen!!! WTF?!?The entire app is peppered with irrelevant sexual factoids such as 'longest recorded erect penis', 'calories per teaspoon of semen', ad nauseum.That is an utterly sensationalist and irresponsible app.I'd planned to use this as a learning tool for my daughter, but was instead  floored by the inordinate amount of entries with blatantly lurid overtones.
3	B004L1I3LW	Got for work
3	B004L1I3LW	its a pretty good random body fact app the best ( and only) ive tried overall its pretty good  :-(
1	B004L1I3LW	Product has a lot of information, appears in random order. I did not find a way to  id information that I wanted to review, however, I am not an expert; perhaps others have found a way.
3	B004L1I3LW	This is a great little app full of random facts about the human body, which does include the fascinating reproductive organs. I love all these fun little facts.
2	B004L1RP3Y	When I recently downloaded I tested before go to class, it worked pretty good and everything, but in my class there's no wi fi networks, and the networks available are from other houses, so I couldn't make it work the rest is just fine
3	B004L1RP3Y	its a good app but it needs Colorado and a nicer picture. I know its the flag of Spain and all but a fifteenth picture would be nice.
1	B004L1RP3Y	I couldn't get it to work.
1	B004L1RP3Y	This translator only lets you translate one word at a time i would imagine it would be easier for you to get a different app because this one takes a long time to use
2	B004L1RP3Y	The problem we have found with translators on Kindle HD is that there is no way (for the one time use)  to change the keyboard to Spanish unless you change it through settings.
1	B004L1RP3Y	The app seemed awkward to use to me. You might have better luck with it than I did, but I ended up removing it. I like Google Translate - works for me.
3	B004L1UGAI	It is good to have a way to convert the time between different time zones. It makes it easier for people like me who don't have enough fingers to do the conversion manually.They could improve it by having a search box where you could type in the city/state/country to get the time zone. That would be helpful, instead of having to scroll through the A to Z listings and to get the time zone for countries that are not listed seperately.
1	B004L1UGAI	Not what I was looking for and seems clunky.  Haven't found a good time zone converter for the Kindle Fire yet.
3	B004L1UGAI	A fun tool as I travel quite a bid. I am not a big tech guy but this is a fun tool as I travel at least once a quarter.
3	B004L1UGAI	Five o'clock somewhere? Yes mornings and evenings. My curiosity did not kill me and never has, but when I want to know something, I look till I find!
1	B004L1UGAI	Having my significant other living across the globe, I was looking for a Kindle app that could convert the two different time zones. All in all, it did that and it was fine. It was fairly easy to understand which is why I would have given this three stars instead of two. The only reason I did give two stars is that the menu to scroll through the different time zones was VERY sensitive, so it was extremely easy to want to scroll a tiny bit down the list when the menu thinks you want to scroll all the way to the end. It was very frustrating, which is unfortunate because the app was okay otherwise.
3	B004L1UGAI	I am so glad i downloaded this app on my new phone. I use it almost everyday to check the time where my friends are.
2	B004L1UGAI	While this app delivers as outlined, I'd hoped for a bit more. It's installed on my kindle fire.  The interface is visually attractive but the output lays at the bottom of the screen in a tiny and cluttered format. The list of world sites is long and unwieldy. The output is not a continually updated display. Instead, a conversion must be performed for every updated display. The application is free which is definitely one of its most attractive features. That being said, there is definitely worse out there.
3	B004L1UGAI	I have a son that works offshore and this keeps me in contact with what time of day it is without having to figure it out.
1	B004L1UGAI	Lots wrong with this app. Cities are random and hard to find. Some are listed under continent, some under country. Some major cities are completely missing. There is no way to add a city or to search the city list there. Definitely a waste.
3	B004L1UGAI	looks like it does what it say it does. would have given 5 stars but type is too small on time for second city. yellow is nice touch but size matters.
3	B004L1UGAI	This app does just what it says it does. My spouse has to travel all around the world for business &amp; it's hard for me to keep track of all the different time zones so we can communicate when both of us are awake. I found this app very helpful.The only thing I don't like is that the time zone u begin with is clear &amp; large but once u Convert the time zone that u want that date &amp; time is very small.That's the only reason for the 4 Star rating.
1	B004L24888	The app was o.k. If you can live ads every 3 seconds then ull be ok. To many adds personally. The jokes are good if you understand them
3	B004L24888	lol omg so funny the yo mama jokes are the best.just so funny so funny download this I will be awesome.
1	B004L24888	worst thing ever the jokes suck and don't make any sense! hate it don't get! EVER! I mean it dont
1	B004L24888	I tried it but some of the jokes are no funny  to the people I tried the jokes to . so you need to change some jokes
1	B004L24888	really bad jokes, couldn't find one thing even remotely funny. uninstalled it pretty quick. if you want super corny and dated jokes this is what you get
3	B004L24888	I think that this app is the best because all the jokes are so funny.get it please works great on kindle fire
1	B004L24888	I was just looking at the photos and I hate this app ....... I know I didn't by it but. but don't buy it you will thank me!!  NEVER BUY THIS GAME.!!!!!!!!!!!! bye :(
1	B004L24888	cheesy STUPID and not funny! just some things that describe this app I'm uninstaling it right after I write this don't waste space on your device!
1	B004L24888	don't buy it! This is a corny,stupid,dumb app. trust me........i hate it! Its the worst app ive had.......it just shows a bunch of stupid,no good jokes.....never buy!
1	B004L24888	this app sucks. the jokes are stupid. a lot of people think the same thing. if you are reading this I hope you know by now NOT to get this.its pointless.
1	B004L24888	WANNA HEAR A JOKE?....  OKTHIS APP IS THE REAL JOKEthe worst ever.  how do cats eat spaghetti.  put in their mouths.  that's not a joke.  That's just sad. if u want a JOKE APP well get a different one  if u want a JOKE OF AN APP..... GET THIS ONE . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .... . .
2	B004L24888	this app is okay but some of the jokes are either lame or hard to get.... some of them are hilarious and others are just plain stupid!!!!!!
3	B004L24888	I have had this app for a while and have found a lot of funny jokes. yes, a lot of them are a thumbs down but just like people I find this app is a really good way to waste time and get a good laugh. BUT DO NOT CLICK ON THE &quot;DIRTY&quot; SECTION ( it covers a lot of gross stuff... like innaproporiate for adults only)  hope this helps
1	B004L24888	jokes are stupid BELIVE ME DONT GET IT jokes like... there is a new barbie a Frankenstein barbie comes with bolts I neck. how is that funny there is 2many dumb ones like apple jokes cat jokes even ardvark jokes. I was exited when it said bar jokes but then I got a hot dog walks into a bar and the bar tender says sorry we don't serve food. please don't get it I beg you not to get it. doesn't deserve a star. booooooooooooooooooooooooo
1	B004L24888	this is lamez the jokes r old I bet Yoda told these jokes to his babysitters when he was a year old
3	B004L24888	How could you downrate such a good app? the jokes are very funny and my little younger cousins find this very hilarious.. althought I must say I have to be. careful wit the random shaker... it has dirty jokes that pop up sometimes... don't pay attention to the downraters.HATERS ARE DOWNRATERS!!! I vote up! sorry... I got carried away... lol.
1	B004L24888	it wuz terrible. i couldnt even get it 2 open. people who invented this, if u r reading this, please make something that tells jokes and works!!!!!!!!!
3	B004L24888	its ok to me I sort of like it. some r kind of funny. people work hard to make these kind of games
3	B004L24888	This app made me laugh so hard I sneeze. The blond jokes were the best. You will love this app.
1	B004L24888	Okay, I didn't even download this app because of the pictures. The one about the dad having to stand up, I didn't find funny at all. And, I don't know if it's just me, but didn't they spell mammal wrong??? P.S. Don't get this app
1	B004L24888	jokes are not funny and once you get it you cant uninstall it don't get fulled by the name its more like FREE NOT FUNNY JOKES this app Is Terribble
2	B004L24888	most of the jokes suck, but overall good app I recommend it to people who like to laugh a loy
3	B004L24888	some of the jokes are a little corny but almost all ive never even heard of.  I think and know that it is great to give a chuckle to sombodys face
1	B004L24888	I had read all the reviews and they sucked but I wanted to see what it wuz so I got it and it won't even open I do not recommend this app
1	B004L24888	this app is the worst! I deleted it the day I got it. please don't get this app u wont like it and its not even funny at all!
3	B004L24GEY	Great little App. Not to be used while playing a round.  But after you've loaded all the course info, you can track your results by hole and round; and it provides your ongoing handicap calculation.  Exactly what I wanted.  Not a GPS.
3	B004L24GEY	it's awesome because I'm only a kid and its awesome. It keeps all my scores and my handicap and my average. if you play golf and you have nothing to keep your scores averages and handicap this is what you'd want to keep all of your things on.
3	B004L24GEY	this ap is really cool. I didn't think it would do as much as it did and it helps me get a good idea of how well I am playing. I would definitely recommend this ap.
2	B004L24GEY	I just wanted a simple app to act as a scorecard during a round  of golf. Although this is not this apps stated purpose, I thought it might do the job. In fact, it does an adequate job of keeping a scorecard for a single player, but only for a single player. It also tracks greens and fairways in regulation, penalty strokes, etc. (and has other capabilities not mentioned here) but those aren't features I was interested in. I'll keep it around until I'm inspired to seek out a better scorecard app.
1	B004L24GEY	did not use
1	B004L26XXQ	I hats this it does not give you the real stations it gives u what people put on there do not get this app.
1	B004L26XXQ	Downloaded, hoping to find a station that was broadcasting a baseball game, but the station choices are EXTREMELY limited.  Couldn't find what I was looking for and the interface was very simplistic and no option to search.  I gave it one star because leaving the rating blank was not an option.  :(
1	B004L26XXQ	I downloaded this app for my Kindle but very few channels actually came in on it.  I removed it and downloaded another app for music and like that one a whole lot more.  Many channels to choose from too.
1	B004L26XXQ	I deleted this as fast as I downloaded it. There are a lot better radio for your Kindle out there.
1	B004L26XXQ	definitely wasn't what I was hoping it would be. worth a shot but I had no desire to keep it.
3	B004L26XXQ	it is good when I'm bourd cuzz music is my thing and if u hate it then u is ************
1	B004L26XXQ	I did not like.I found that i heart works best for me.I would not recommend.It could work for you
1	B004L26XXQ	The FM Radio app is okay, but the connectivity did not seem to be as solid as my i-heart radio app.
3	B004L26XXQ	works just fine on my kindle. For those who don't understand its for Internet radio stations. Its not intended to pickup over the air stations. maybe its the name that is confusing those who don't read the description.
1	B004L26XXQ	This application need more options for the end users because they're who makes important with their opinion make it more useful please.
1	B004L26XXQ	this makes no sense why would you need internert for the radio?????? wat the fudge!!!!! makes none sence just lik ths sintense
1	B004L26XXQ	ha im thinking about getting this app and i want to know if i can listen to 107.9 also can you get to specific channels
1	B004L26XXQ	Just my opinion, but this little FM radio app doesn't have any bells and whistles, making it impossible to explore internet radio like I would like.
3	B004L26XXQ	Does what it says it will. Very few drop outs. There are some better ones out there, but this will do find for free.
1	B004L26XXQ	Not much to pick from, nothing in the Tulsa market and just generally a bad app. There a good ones out there but this ain't one of 'em.
1	B004L26XXQ	I did not care for this app. the reception was not very good and i just did not care for it.
2	B004L26XXQ	It is really nice to have a radio on my kindle. It has a lot of styles to choose from. However it does skip occasionally. And I've found that if I play it for a long period of time it will freeze completely.  All in all, I will recommend it to people who want to listen to the radio on their devices.
1	B004L26XXQ	Apps like this one is the reason they made iheart radio. All this app has is what iheart radio is only with less stuff.
1	B004L26XXQ	Too many other apps available to get radio for free that have more selection. Just too limited, but it does work.
1	B004L26XXQ	Loaded this on my Kindle fire and never got even one station to come in.  It would either just keep buffering, or say the station is not available or the signal is too weak.  I have successfully used a radio app on my iPod that worked just fine, so I don't know what the problem was here.
1	B004L26XXQ	Downloaded but nothing happens, no stations, no signal, no nothing. So I proceded to undo this download, that is all.
1	B004L26XXQ	this app doesn't. work for my kindle. the music goes off whenever the kindle goes on power save mode and it takes a while to get the radio station to work again. not good at all.
2	B004L26XXQ	FM Radio is nice app, and when it works, I use and like it.  But recently it does not seem to respond well.  I have no idea what's going on or why, but if it starts to seem unreliable, it is going to be history....  Maybe it's not the app, but other thinngs seem to work normally.
3	B004L26XXQ	This app allows you to chose and customize your preference to what type of music you like let alone what stae you want to listen to it from.
2	B004L26XXQ	It's a web based radio for the kindle fire.  Listen to radio stations from around the us without an antenna
1	B004L26XXQ	It's a small program! It doesn't so much radio stations! The interface is primitive. I don't recommend for anyone. I don't like this program.
2	B004L26XXQ	I did not care to much for this radio and the channels were not coming in clear, so I just gave up on it!
1	B004L26XXQ	I uninstalled this as soon as I installed it. I dont like it. enuff said I didnt get the stations I wanted.
1	B004L26XXQ	connects slow; buffers a long timeturns off when you leave the screen so you can't listen to radio in background to somehing elseodd stations
1	B004L26XXQ	I was disappointed with this purchase.  There are only selected stations to choose from.  You can only use if you have wifi service.
3	B004L5WS2S	good simple mindless fun for kids of all ages. way better then the dreck Amazon had up earlier.Kudos to Amazon for listening to your clients and removing a painfully bad app and replacing it with better fare. That was the first app I have noticed them pull.
3	B004L5WS2S	This game has a good mix of fun and difficulty to keep players entertained for hours especially if you try to get the max on all levels.
2	B004L5WS2S	Not fat finger friendly and I don't generally have fat finger problems. Fun game but annoyingly easy to select the wrong plane/destination.
1	B004L5WS2S	This game just makes me laugh thinking that people would spend time playing these levels or pay money to upgrade the game, I do not recommend this app
3	B004L5WS2S	I was pleasantly surprised to see this game consume my time! I finally beat it and am very glad that I got this game in the first place
3	B004L5WS2S	Absolutely addicting.  I didn't put my phone down until i had 3 stars on all levels.  I hope they release new airports soon.Moto Droid2.
3	B004L5WS2S	Game provides many hours of plane landing, maintenance, and take-off time. I don't like how the upgrade shop works. If you buy something, it only applies to future levels. If you go back and play a level you've already passed,the item you've bought will be taken away :(. I hope they make an update to fix that. Other than that, pretty fun game.
3	B004L5WS2S	I enjoyed the game but finished it within a few days. I would have liked more levels. otherwise no complaints.
3	B004L5WS2S	I LOVED this game! It's so much fun! The only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because I finished it. I would play a game like the until the day I die, so I wish there were more levels!!!
3	B004L5WS2S	I love this game! its so fun and addicting! i think its worth the money! I just wish there were more stages and levels...
3	B004L5WS2S	Samsung Verizon fascinate. Runs fine. this game is very addictive; I had to keep playing until I beat all the levels, then I had to go for max scores and awards.
3	B004L5WS2S	This game was my first experience with the AM games, and I still adore it. Runs without any glitches on both my EVO phone and Asus Transformer tablet. Clean graphics and the music is cheerful without being annoying.
2	B004L5WS2S	This is a fun little time management game, for sure. Well designed, nice art assets, and responsive controls.Unfortunately, the game gets very laggy as the difficulty increases and there are more objects on the screen. After world 4 the game is nearly unplayable because of the laggy framerate. I'm on an overclocked EVO 4G, so it's not because I'm using low end hardware.Hopefully they can improve the game in updates, because it has great potential.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a really fun game. i first got the free app. i upgraded the first time it was offered free. later levels get challenging, as you try to keep the planes happy. my only complaint is that it isn't a very long game. still, it's a great app.
3	B004L5WS2S	this is the first smartphone app that was so addicting and fun that i played for an hour and a half straight
3	B004L5WS2S	From the first day I got this app I was hooked.  You really have to not only be quick with getting the planes landed, but also with how to manage them on the ground (including getting them fixed and gassed).  You could do much worse than this game.  Purchase and enjoy!
3	B004L5WS2S	Thanks Amazon for the freebie!  This came is an engaging little sim, directing air traffic to load, unload, repair, fuel, etc. the airplanes at the airport.  I'm addicted... lol
3	B004L5WS2S	Completed the game in the first day I had it.  There is a new update that I have not installed yet.  Hoping that it had new levels.
3	B004L5WS2S	i love it, but i finished all levels in a month. For 99&cent;, i should get more levels and stuff to add on. Please upgrade soon!!
3	B004L5WS2S	I found this game to be very fun and entertaining for hours. It has very good graphics, and the game play is easy to understand. The levels get challenging. This overall is a top notch mobile game. Well worth 99 cents!
3	B004L5WS2S	I took away a star because it's too repeatative. But that's also the charm to the game. I love that you can upgrade your airport.
3	B004L5WS2S	When I first saw this game, I thought it looked a lot like Air Traffic Chaos, and indeed, it does share some of the same mechanics, albeit in a much simplified form.Like ATC, you have to clear planes to land, send them to a gate, direct them to refuel or get repairs, then authorize them for take off.  Unlike ATC however, planes cannot crash into one another and the actual sequence of events is greatly shortened (e.g., aircraft take off almost right away instead of having to wait for pull back, taxiing to the runway and then taking off).  The game also lacks the complicated radio communications of ATC.Works great on the Xoom.
3	B004L5WS2S	Loved the pc version from like 4 yrs ago. just saw add for AM 2, so people stop rating low for lack of levels, theyre working on the app. And the reason its easy is because its a kids' game. I love it!! thank you so much for making it an app!
3	B004L5WS2S	this is a very nice game to have in your phone. a lot of fun, can be made interesting, i just love it.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is the best game ever!!! It is soo addicting, simple and eases you into understanding the controls of the game. Very enjoyable :) I paid for this app because I love it so much, I also have #2! The only thing is color blind people can not see the difference with the colors, you should add shapes on the sides of the planes. Diversity.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a very fun and addicting strategy game. If you've ever played Diner Dash, it is similar in design. The airplanes are quite entertaining and the game complex enough to not get bored. I highly recommend.
1	B004L5WS2S	would not install on my cyanogen modded g1 that has apps2sd. install says not enough available space yet i have 200mb of phone storage and 500mb of sd card storage available
3	B004L5WS2S	This app is very fun.  My kids love it, and we're looking forward to playing with the next incarnation of this game.  Cute graphics make for a very nice time-killing and boredom busting game.
3	B004L5WS2S	This game has good dev feedback and continues to be updated. Good graphics and great sound. Not bad for just1 dollar.
3	B004L5WS2S	Pretty challenging when you get to the upper levels but not impossible.  Once you beat it you'll find yourself wanting to start over!  Looking for similar games now.
3	B004L5WS2S	I love this game and have been playing this like crazy every since i got it, but honestly I would like the colors on the planes to be more saturated, without that I end up missing the color combos the game gives you. A lot of times I need my wife to sit next to me to tell whether a plane is green or yellow or orange. The color changing layover area is the only help but it doesn't recharge fast enough to be of help. I love this game and would like to be able to play this without as much stress, I saw that there were other reviews which mentioned the lack of color blind mode in this game. Is the developer listening??? You don't have to do much, just make the colors more saturated or just don't use colors which are similar to color blind people !! White, Black, Yellow, Blue could work just as well as the current set of colors. Please, please fix this, this would make the game less infuriating. Don't discriminate against the colorblind, they are people too !
3	B004L5WS2S	I got this app for free but have bought it for the rest of the family. it looks simple but it is very engaging and fun! well worth $0.99.
3	B004L5WS2S	Simple game that is entertaining and mildly challenging that requires attention in order to do well.  Fun in a repetitive way.
3	B004L5WS2S	The most addictive game I've played on android. Fun, with good graphics and very easy to learn. Glad I found it on here. Lots if levels if game play.
3	B004L5WS2S	The developers really put in the effort with this port.  The game, which is fantastic by the way, really interfaces well with the Android OS (Froyo, HTC incredible). No running background task when minimized, and loads pretty quickly to the gameplay from click on icon to playing the game.
3	B004L5WS2S	definitely helps kill the time. ive played it during break, at jury duty, during lunches. its a cute little task management game.
3	B004L5WS2S	I am having fun with this app. I played the free version and really liked it. It gets more challenging the more you play, so happy I bought it.
3	B004L5WS2S	This app is a great game.  Lots of fun and little achievements top enhance replayability.  I highly recommend it.Droid X running 2.2
3	B004L5WS2S	It's a great time waster. I can play this gamel for hours. It's awesome. Graphics are pretty great for a mobile phone app. Sound can get a bit annoying at menu. They should make different soundtrack for different zones.
3	B004L5WS2S	Decent game for the style, probably the only one I will play in the genre...... But seriously amazon, it was free less than a month ago!
3	B004L5WS2S	I got this app when it was free for a day. Thought it would suck, but wanted to try it anyway. I was wrong! I played it till my battery died! Fun little time waster. Worth the price, IMO.
3	B004L5WS2S	Love the game, cant stop playing it.  I think you love it too!  It will keep you busy at the office, jajaja
3	B004L5WS2S	I like it, it is a good time killer. It is very repetitive though, once you master the game is like playing it over and over again. I would recommend it for sure, it is good for commuting, or a quick app to keep you busy for a while. It is not addictive though. You can stop it and come back whenever.
2	B004L5WS2S	It is very similar to Diner dash, but after four or five levels you get pretty bored.  It does get more difficult, but not in a way I appreciated.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a great game for the cost. It is very addicting and has a good mix of difficulty and fun. I strongly recommend it.
3	B004L5WS2S	Great game. Just downloaded update and not sure what it was for. This and Angry Birds are my two favs. Check out tge newest version too!
3	B004L5WS2S	I love these airport games but this one has totally erased all of my progress. Not fun. Could you please fix this? Thanks
3	B004L5WS2S	This game is very addictive. I couldn't put it down and will pay it again even if another version isn't made
3	B004L5WS2S	This is pretty fun, and runs very nicely on my phone. I would recommend this game for all ages. The design is nice, and I love the airplanes.Great job on making this game for our mobile devices!
3	B004L5WS2S	This was a great fun game. It does get challenging if you want a good score. I enjoyed it all the way through.
3	B004L5WS2S	The game is not that bad.  Some levels are challenging. Only draw back is the money is kind of pointless. After each stage you lose it all and have to start over.  But even with that it is a fun game.
3	B004L5WS2S	Had this on my I-Touch. Good to be able to have a bigger screen (Kindle Fire). My OCD is back, now going through this getting perfect scores for all the levels.
3	B004L5WS2S	The game is easy, fun, and hard to put down. The difficulty ramps up nicely and 3-stars and medals give you something to work for.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a really fun game if you like the Diner Dash style of games. I played through it on my phone (G2x) and my tablet (Galaxy Tab 10.1). It looks good on both devices.
3	B004L5WS2S	Took a while to get perfect on all levels, but i enjoyed it.  Moto Droid 1, ran well and looks great
3	B004L5WS2S	This plays very similar to the Diner Dash style of games.  You must land, unload, load and take off (while occasionally repairing and refueling) planes in a dance like none other.  Fortunately, the game is very simple to get your head around and all levels are easily passed.  3*ing levels also are not all that difficult, but may take a couple tries every once in a while.I highly recommend this game to anyone who hasn't gotten it yet.
3	B004L5WS2S	Great game and a great time waster. Wish there were more levels though as once you get the hang of it the game goes by quick. Also, works great on a tablet which is definitely preferred.
3	B004L5WS2S	I enjoyed the heck out of this. It doesn't last long enough, though, and there's really no ending. Also, the game lies, saying &quot;NO ONE has gotten 3 stars in all the levels&quot;. Well, I have, so I'm sure others have before me. ;)
3	B004L5WS2S	Sometimes the planes may block the background where you need to click. Especially on later stages where you have whole screen full of planes. Other than that, very addictive game. Well worth the 99 cents
3	B004L5WS2S	Great graphics and easy to play. Simple and straight forward.  Prefect &quot;before bed&quot; game for me.  Although I did finish it in about a week and now I'll delete it to make room for something else.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is very similar to Diner Dash but there is something a little 'easier' or more simple about it. It is great to play on the Droid (although I had some glitches for a level or two but somehow got past them).Every stage has multiple levels and begins your work at a new airport, just like Flo kept buying new restaurants. But the airports are frustrating since some of them have a better layout than others. I have an issue with selecting a gate only to find that the game actually selected the next one over. This is frustrating if you are trying to color combos. It's a small screen thing though and not worth worrying about.For the price, there is a ton of game play and worth every penny.
3	B004L5WS2S	I bought this game awhile back.Best 99cents I ever spent.Reflexive is the best.I want my kids playing games like this.I trust reflexive in my childrens minds.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a great app, but as an adult I felt a little too old to be playing it. Its fun nonetheless.
1	B004L5WS2S	got this as faotd months ago and it just couldn't hold my attention. thought it might be something fun to do with my 5 year old son. even he couldn't say anything exciting about it. don't really have anything bad to say.... just nothing good either.
1	B004L5WS2S	I liked the game but had to uninstall due to lag issues. It was impossible to get a decent score because the game took forever to recognize my commands.
3	B004L5WS2S	Really fun app! I love it. Great price too. Just gotta buy it asap. Now to fill up twenty five words for free from for
3	B004L5WS2S	This game is addicting, and at less than a buck, worth every penny!  If I wasn&apos;t sure the 2nd airport mania game was going to be the faotd the day after I buy it, I would have already bought that one too!
3	B004L5WS2S	Think Diner Dash with planes. So, why not go for this fun and cute game? Btw, I got this as Amazon&apos;s free app of the day, but it&apos;s worth $0.99 because it&apos;s a good game. :)
3	B004L5WS2S	very easy learn, love how you can earn bouns points my matching the plane to the gate color or if it gets to crazy send them to any one. really helps make it easy to play or you can challenge your self buy racking up multipliers
1	B004L5WS2S	What a waste of money. The game is upside down on my Kindle Fire. When I turn my Kindle the other way, it goes upside down again.
3	B004L5WS2S	I have yet to test the app thoroughly but an HD version or update in options for capable devices would be nice. Fun and cute game. Very addicting.
3	B004L5WS2S	My wife and I both really enjoy this game. The puzzles aren't very challenging but it's a good time waster. it makes me feel like an ATC ground tower controller.
3	B004L5WS2S	Try to get a perfect score on each and every  level/round!  Makes it quite challenging,  I highly recommend this product!  Game will suck you in and keep you entertained! Try Airport Mania 2 also!
3	B004L5WS2S	Easily one of the best games I've gotten from Amazon, free no less. Game plays great on droid x, very addicting!  The first mobile time management game I've played. Only complaints I have are 1) game is way too short, 2) hard to distinguish the different airplanes. Neither of which detract from the awesome of this game. Can we get a sequel soon Amazon?
3	B004L5WS2S	I'm a fan of the time management genre of game, and this is the first one I've played on Android.  Cute theme, and well done!
3	B004L5WS2S	Whenever I have a few minutes to kill, i go straight to this. Fantastic game for any time you need to kill about 5 minutes.
2	B004L5WS2S	This game is cute....for kids...i actually prefer Flight Control....its free so if you want to give it a try, to each their own...as they say.
3	B004L5WS2S	I'm a fan of diner dash and cake mania, so this was right up my alley. It's the same idea but with airplanes. I just wish there were more levels.
3	B004L5WS2S	I was unsure about this game at first but I got really hooked. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, it&apos;s challenging, and it has great replay value. One of the best games I&apos;ve downloaded.
2	B004L5WS2S	It was a fun game until it froze and locked up my Motorola Defy. After that, I couldn't get the game to load. Maybe I'll order it for my PC instead. :(
3	B004L5WS2S	Got this a while back - this game is great fun, and well worth a buck or two. Gameplay is simple and intuitive, and the cartoony graphics are appealing.
3	B004L5WS2S	I beat the game. So I bought the second one! Really well made and simple unless you want to be perfect at it.
3	B004L5WS2S	Absolutely loved this game. It was very addictive indeed. I could have used a few more levels though...maybe we'll get those thru an update.Gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the app hangs on start on the atrix. I have to try to start it 5 to 6 times before it finally starts working.
3	B004L5WS2S	Cute, fun, and addicting time management game. Frustrating and panic inducing like all good time management games should be, with cute and fun graphics, and brilliant colors. Some of the colors are too similar though, I end up losing bonuses because I put a plane in a hangar that I thought was the same color, only to find that it was a slightly different shade. I beat this game in one day because I couldn&apos;t put it down!
3	B004L5WS2S	A very cute, organizational skills challenging game. The game and upgrades do get monotonous after a while though. The HD version is not much better than this one. Save money by getting this one.
3	B004L5WS2S	game runs perfect on my 3VO. very fun and addicting. controls could use a little work as it can be hard to click accurately even with a 4.3&quot; screen and it needs a fuel hint the same way the smoke hints at repairs.
3	B004L5WS2S	This is what mobile gaming should be, fast, intuitive, and fun. This game gets progressively harder and paces itself well.
3	B004L5WS2S	It was very big of Amazon to realize their mistake with pay-to-play Solitary Deluxe and replace it with Airport Mania... This is a great little game for all ages! I was upset this morning, but you have redeemed yourselves Amazon! Thanks!
3	B004L5WS2S	best app I've ever played! this app is fun for children. for more airport mania, see airport mania the free version, and airport mania 2: Wild Trips!
3	B004L5WS2S	A great game to kill 2 minutes or 20 minutes, you would think the gameplay would get old, but it doesn't. Highly recommended.
2	B004L5WS2S	Yeah, I can play this game, but like another reviewer, I cannot pass any levels where they want you to land planes in certain color runways.  The planes look all identical to me..I've had this problem with other games as well (Puzzle Fighter).I'm not 100% color blind, but just partially, so certain shades of green/orange look identical to me and are hard to differentiate.Same with purple/pink, etc.Needs to be more obvious colors like Red or Blue, or Yellow/Red.
3	B004L5WS2S	Keep the airports running by making sure planes come in and depart without being late and ensuring passengers are happy.  Repair the planes, gas them up, generate money and upgrade the 8 airports.  Epic 4G stock froyo.  This game has nice, simple graphics and has good sound effects but is an easy game for the most part.  The "supreme score" should have been another 5-10% higher which would force the player to rely on the high scoring multipliers when you get the same color plane to dock with a gate over and over again.  On some levels I cleared the "supreme score" by nearly 20%, which shows the game needs to have the top-level difficult raised a bit.
3	B004L5WS2S	I really enjoyed playing this game. I pretty much went non stop until I completed all the stages with 3 stars.
3	B004L5WS2S	I love this little game. It's definitely a great time killer. Sometimes I find I killed a little too much time. Definitely worth buying. A+++ app.
3	B004L5WS2S	I thought ok freebie. I love it. Can't wait for Son to try tomorrow. If I decide to stop playing. The graphics are nice and simple and game play is simple but gets difficult as it plays on. I haven't found anything wrong. I would have bought this if I had tried the Free version first. Thanks Amazon for freebie days
3	B004L5WS2S	This game is the best game in the hole wide world!!!!!! I played it 3 days strait without stopping! My mom couldn't get me away from the game! If u get this game, u have to have fast fingers! GET THIS GAME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	B004L5WS2S	This is definitely a game worth picking up if you're into games like Farmville its a fairly easy concept to pick but does become a little challenging in the later levels. I recommend this one to anyone looking for a fun casual game to play while waiting around or bored. Don't be surprised if you kill your battery playing this all day
3	B004L5WS2S	As much as I like this game I can play it that well.  In fact I cannot pass the tutorial levels. If the colors were more vivid then I would have a better understanding of them and be able to play the game.  Please make the colors richer so that I may be able to play
3	B004L5WS2S	really fun to play, love the colors and the fact that it seems appropriate for all ages. The little plane sounds are so funny lol! The only problem is each time I make enough money to finally buy all the things I need, I'm already at the end of that stage and have to start over again at another stage.
3	B004L5WS2S	Excelente aplicaccion....para jugar entre varios......me gusto mucho...gran variedad de niveles.....uno diferente del otro muy bueno para pasar el tiempo......corre muy bien en mi DROID X
3	B004L5WS2S	There are several apps that share the same air traffic controller idea. This one users toon graphics and friendly controls. Sort of a diner dash version with airplanes, and props to devs originality.
3	B004L5WS2S	I got this as the free app of the day and had it finished by that night. It is really addicting and fun. I do wish there were more levels, but now I'm going through again in paper airplane mode trying to get three stars in each level, which I think may be impossible :PThe characters are cute, even when they get angry and impatient.Lots of fun!
3	B004L5WS2S	This is a very fun game. levels become progressively harder without getting frustrating. Each level is short enough to play wherever you have free time and there are enough levels to stay busy for a long time
1	B004L5WS2S	Motorola Atrix \nI expected a crash or two from an airplane game but I have yet to see it run. Maybe next time.
3	B004L5WS2S	Spent several hours playing this game and finished all stages with three stars.  I don't know why the other reviewer with an EVO had problems after stage 4. The game did slow down a tiny bit when there were a lot of planes but did not really effect gameplay. I'm looking forward to more games like this Amazon.
3	B004L5WS2S	This game looks like it's designed for kids. However, after playing only a few rounds it becomes addictive. quite entertaining!
3	B004L5WS2S	Wow am I hooked on this game! Give it a try, it's worth it!! (20 word min) word word word
3	B004L5WS2S	Still one of my all time favorite games! Thank you for making it available for my Nookcolor:) rooted of course.
3	B004L5WS2S	So I downloaded this a month ago when it was the free app of the day. I still play it. When a game can keep me entertained for over a month it definitely deserves 5 stars. A+ developer. Thanks.
3	B004L5WS2S	Nice time management game. very addictive. I have played through it twice now. Nice time killer. HTC EVO 4G. Thank you for this great game.
3	B004L5WS2S	This game seemed kind of lame at first, but after playing a bit, and once I learned about the different strategies, it became quite fun and addictive. I highly recommend.
3	B004L5WS2S	Install on COWON D3 yesterday and haven't stopped playing yet.Has to be one of the best game i have purchased from amazon, since i don't have the market.Worth the dollar you won't be disapointed
3	B004L5WS2S	Really great app. Very addicting. I wish they would update with new maps considering I finished it in less than a week. Great graphics too.
3	B004L5WS2S	I have this game for pc and for such a simple game it keeps me interested and entertained. There are no bugs in the game, graphics are nice, overall a great buy. I'm pleased and would recommend to anyone who has played the free version and enjoyed it.
3	B004L5WS2S	Amazon says this app is not compatible with the Viewsonic gTablet but I can testify the it works great.  I would not suggest that someone with problems with high blood pressure or problems handling stress try it.  It can get quite intense at the higher levels.  At least the planes don't run into each other like real air traffic control, but it does give you a real sense of what a ground controller has to deal with while keeping it a fun game
2	B004L5WS2S	Had this game on my android phone and it was great. Installed it on the kindle, and regardless of the orientation, everything is upside down. I will admit that it makes things a lot more challenging.
1	B004L5WS2S	Instant crash on my motorola defy. Didnt even see the game just the intro. I'll wait for an update I guess
3	B004L5WS2S	Excellent game for the price.  Similar to Diner Dash, but 1/5 the price.  You basically run an airport by landing planes, unloading passengers, refueling the planes, etc.  Works great on my Droid Incredible.
3	B004L5WS2S	I really dig these little strategy games. There is plenty of challenge and levels... The graphics and smooth operation is nice. Droid X. Lost one star cause it can be hard to figure out how much money you have to spend.
3	B004L5WS2S	Good learning curve, not as easy or juvenile as I was expecting simply from seeing the cute planes. Challenging enough to re-play to increase  my score. A few bugs after you complete the game but nothing that hinders re-play, just oddness.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	There is nothing like having a woot notification to brighten your day.  Woot-off notifications and that great orange (err umm yellow?) light to shine.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	The best woot checking app out there, especially since the push notifications were added.  Highly recommended.  I think that it's worth paying for the donation version!
3	B004L5ZJ9C	Can't be at your computer for 48 hours straight during a Woot Off? No worries. Just get this WootWatcher app for your Android device (I use it on my Kindle Fire) and you're all set. Super simple to use and a life saver when trying to land a BOC or a screaming monkey!
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This handy app is great for tracking daily Woot offerings and the periodic "Woot-Off" (quick, limited quantity deals that run for a day or two). This provides notifications when there is a new deal and allows tracking of the various Woot sites in the options.The app installs and runs perfectly on my HTC EVO 4G.Highly Recommended!CFH
3	B004L5ZJ9C	I had this app on my phone a long time ago, found it for my Kindle and downloaded it. Easy to use, great app!
2	B004L5ZJ9C	I had to remove this from my phone.  It was always running, and it could not be moved to SD.  It is handy during a Woot Off, and I may reinstall during Woot offs, but it is a pest the rest of the time.  If it could move to SD and be programed to only be active during Woot offs.  I would love it.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	I love to shop Woot! They have great prices on items I am interested in! I have found many great gifts for others, as well as several &#34;wants&#34; & &#34;needs&#34; for myself! The WootWatcher is a fantastic way to quickly know what is being offered for sale on Woot, or when they have a Woot Off, as Woot says!! Check it out, you'll love the deals!!
2	B004L5ZJ9C	I thought that this might help me keep track of Woot Offs. It turned out not to work for me because I seldom remember to run the app.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This is probably the best Woot app out there, and I've tried a lot of em. Easy to use from day to day, fantastic for woot-offs. But it doesn't have an sd card storage option, and for me that knocks it down a star.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	The woot watcher does what it says. It monitors woot and will alert you during a woot-off of new devices. I wish the app would include an option to cache my account information to auto-buy the bag of crap when it comes up. So many scripts are out there it's virtually impossible to get the bag of crap the "old-fashioned way".
3	B004L5ZJ9C	They couldn't have done it any better. This app checks all woot sites and allows for individual notifications for each site. Fast to load, reliable, and intuitive. Did I mention it has push notifications? Perfect for wootoffs!I've tried other apps and this is the best without question.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	An essential for a Woot Off and if you want to have any opportunity to obtain a Bag of Crap.Love this application.It works well.Never freezes.No complaints.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	Anyone familiar with Woot.com knows this is a fun site with (occasionally) incredible deals, that can be very addicting. This app is just the next step down that road to addiction!
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This is one of my favorite apps...on my phone. But on my Kindle Fire HD, like my First-Gen Kindle Fire before it, the push notification service is non-functional. Because of this, I forget to check the app when I wake up. If there's any way this can be fixed, please fix it, Mr. Tobin. Other than that, a great app with a nice Holo UI.
2	B004L5ZJ9C	I was trying to get into Woot.com and downloaded this WootWatcher app. The app does what it advertises, and it does it very well. I got bored with Woot and ending up just uninstalling this app as the alerts in the middle of the night were obnoxious.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	What a great app and it is much better than the iTunes app which does not have several of the woot pages.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This app notifies you whenever Woot updates one of it's items.It includes the woot of the day, shirt, kids, home, wine and mofi.App allows you to change the notification color if a woot off starts. This is useful, because in a woot-off, you want to know asap when a new item comes up. Otherwise, you loose your chance at it, or possibly, a BOC.I've been wooting for a while, so maybe that's why I like it. If you don't woot often, probably not your cup of tea. But it works well, and takes you right to the new item with a tap on the notification. Even tells you what the new item is, so you can ignore it if you don't wine shop, for example.MyTouch 4G
2	B004L5ZJ9C	With woot.com recently changing their site to offer several deals per site, this app no longer handles the task. I am unable to see the other listings and I also get multiple notifications per day for the same items. This app definitely needs an update to keep up with the changes on the site.3 stars until they catch up with woot.com
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This app is perfect. You can very easily check all of what woot has to sell every day. You will not bo wrong in downloading this free app.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	This app is very helpful for those who love Woot! I use it on my tablet to keep up to date with the latest deals. Very handy.
2	B004L5ZJ9C	I love woot. You need to open the browser to buy anything. Force closed a few times. Definitely needs some work in general. As well as I removed this before I thought to check, but a woot-off would kill your battery pretty fast if you don't change the refresh rate(if this app allows you too). With that being said, it's the best woot app i've used, so that something. With a little work, could be something thats nice to have around.
3	B004L5ZJ9C	What can I say that hasn't already been said? It works fine for the most part. Alerts can get tedious but that's what the app is all about. I still find myself going to the woot.com website so not sure if its really worth having personally, but I recommend it for those who like keeping tight tabs on Woot deals.
3	B004L67EJY	It does the job.  It would be a big plus if it had a way to bookmark your place or skip to chapters within a book.  Navigation is straightforward.
3	B004L67EJY	This audio book player does it all - remembers your last position, makes it easy to combine many individual files from your own audio books into one easy 'title'.  It does the absolute best job of obtaining, maintaining, and ending 'focus' with your bluetooth headset - i.e. - if you start the App all your headset buttons will control Ambling - if you leave and listen to music with another App, Ambling 'releases' control so your headset will control the music.  Go back to the book, Ambling's back.  Awesome especially if you have experienced false starts or restarts between Apps.The killer is this, however:  I had to reset my Kindle Fire HD due to the Amazon Mp3 Player App malfunctioning.  Easy enough to restore a lot of my content, either from my PC or from the Amazon Cloud.  Problem is, I think, since we had the latest Fire update, Amazon is stating that the App is not compatible with my device, and perhaps the developer has not confirmed that the App is compatible with this update.No matter really though, the incompatibility statement is incorrect.I found a free .apk trial version of Ambling and side-loaded it; it works fine - it just stops every 10 minutes as it is a trial version.We need the developers to confirm that the App indeed works with the Kindle Fire HD and we need the Amazon App Dept. to check out the App and confirm, as I have, that it works, has never stopped working and all is good to goThat dreaded 'incompatibility' red 'X' needs to be removed :).I cannot access this the Ambling App online here at Amazon, so thus it cannot be loaded onto my device despite Amazon's warning; the red 'X' makes the App sit in limbo - unusable, non-refundable, despite having used it since 27 February 2013 until the reset of the device, 29 June 2013PLEASE - OH - PLEASE (lol), pretty please? HELP! :)I use this App everyday, flawlessly - makes work hurry by; makes walking the dog even more fun.  I don't care if it is $18.99 rather than $8.99 - folks, it IS THAT GOOD.*****UPDATE TO POST (just a few hours later actually!)*****I managed to find the full Ambling BookPlayer Pro through some diligent searching - I just had to see if it really was no longer 'compatible'.The App I found installed and is running perfectly.  No conflicts, no errors, no forced closing.  It is totally compatible.  Hopefully the developer and Amazon will get together and fix this soon.  Will use paid App once Amazon allows me to install it from my Cloud - until then, its gonna have to be the one I found.********UPDATE TO UPDATE***********Very disturbing news from developer - they stated, as I already found out for myself, that there is no inherent conflict or incompatibility with the app - they speculate that it may be due to the fact that Amazon has Audible and Ambling has its own service to purchase audiobooks - so the competition is being shut down.  The problem is that the Audible audiobook player is vastly inferior to Ambling's player.  For one thing, if you are using bluetooth headphones and have your Kindle Fire closed up, say while you are out walking and listening to your book, you can barely (if at all) control the Audible player via your bluetooth headphones(set).  Very aggrevating to have to open the device to pause or change anything but the volume.  For another thing, Ambling has other bookmarking features that are superior to Audible.All in all, if it is a matter of a billion dollar company fighting a small company, to squeeze out a few thousand more, that's good business?  Really?  Sort of vulgar when one's profit is already plentiful and in no danger of evaporating.  This attitude of excess = success is killing some of my sky-high good will toward Amazon.Remedy this - be fair and realize Amazon - we love you but stay honest, because if you don't we can't in good faith stick around and assist you in killing innovation by killing all your competition.  AT&T.;  Micro$oft.  Monopoly is only fun when its a board game.  :)***UPDATE AGAIN***STILL this app is not being recognized as compatible with the Kindle Fire HD.  I have a confirmed purchase in Feb 2013 and it worked perfectly then and up until the last software update.  The functinality NEVER STOPPED WORKING, so a statement of incompatibility is just a flat out lie.I have come across the .apk for Ambling and it works PERFECTLY.  Audible's app is still inferior in just about every way to Ambling's.  The features in Audible are simplistic while the prices for the audio books are not - thus if you are going to deactivate an app that was $8.99, in favor of your own, inferior app, then the least you can do, Amazon, is update your Audible app to **at least** fake an attempt to match quality and performance.The idea that purchases from Ambling could in ANY WAY take significant traffic from Audible is laughable and a public insult.  I have been a VERY loyal customer to Amazon for years, but this petty bait-and-switch, to earn a few thousand dollars on top of their billions, is quickly eroding my loyalty, and as word gets around, it will erode loyalty for others.  Amazon - FIX THIS ISSUE.  Stop deactivating apps that might be a miniscule competitor to you - especially when you know it will not effect your bottom line a bit.  This is tremendously disappointing.
3	B004L67EJY	I've owned multiple iPods (Touch, shuffle, and now my Nano) and a first generation Zune.  I've owned other mp3 players.  With all but one (a SanDisk product I owned a long time ago) I've always complained about how they treat audiobooks, usually as an afterthought.  In fact, I'm sure I've mentioned it in every mp3 player I've reviewed.Even with the Android I was not happy with the MP3 player as, it too, had the same problem.  But Android held the potential that somebody would design a better player with Audiobooks in mind, specifically the ability to bookmark.  What I didn't expect to find, or even think of, was a player with nothing BUT audiobooks in mind.  And then I found Ambling!This is FANTASTIC!!!  It has nearly everything I'm looking for (I'll make a wish list at the end) and makes for a great audiobook listening experience.  I also love how customizable it is, even giving you the option to determine how far back to "rewind" a book.  Apple sticks it at 30 seconds, which I think is too much and they do not allow you to change that option.  The 15 seconds they suggest is pretty good... I'm more for about ten seconds myself with a five-second skip forward.Another option that I love is that when you haven't listened to a book for a little bit it will jump back a few seconds (an option you can turn off if you don't like that).  How excellent!  It is nice to catch the last few sentences to re-establish yourself into a scene or conversation.  Again with Apple I either have to accept the jarring or listen to a full 30 seconds when I jump back into a book.They even have the ability to find and download audiobooks (some for free) off the Internet.One feature that I love is that it doesn't only show the progress of a chapter, or audio file (depending on how it is split up) but it shows the progress of the entire book as well!  It probably isn't that big a deal because with some quick math I can usually figure it out on other players, but it is nice to look down and see the overall progress and how much time altogether I have for an entire book.Another reason this has become my go-to player is that when I'm listening to my iPod and a phone call comes in on my cell phone (my Android phone) I have to pause the audiobook on the iPod and then answer the phone.  With Ambling it pauses automatically and then automatically resumes as soon as the phone call is over.The bookmarking features are GREAT!!  Yes, I do listen to multiple books at once as I usually have two books on non-fiction and one -- sometimes two -- books on fiction.  So the bookmarking is a must-have feature that I think should be built into every mp3 player.  Not only can you manually set a bookmark, but one is set every time you pause a book as well.  That way if you change books without bookmarking you can easily find and go back to where you left off on a particular book with a few taps of your finger.  You can even name your bookmarks, in case there is a passage you wish to listen to again and again (I do this with my scriptures).I like how this creates an icon in your notification bar.  This means that, no matter what screen I'm on, if Ambling is running I can bring down the player with a swipe and a poke, and work with the application (pause, run, go to another book, etc).  This is really convenient and a feature I really like.As I've said in some of my other reviews, a product is only as good as its support.  This app has excellent support!  Case-in-point: I had a question with regards to the player and sent them an Email on a Sunday, not expecting a reply until at least the next day.  I was wrong, the reply came within an hour... ON A SUNDAY (I stress).  This actually turned into a bit of a conversation (due to the nature of my question), but within a couple of hours everything was taken care of.  Did I mention this occurred on a Sunday?  I am very, very, VERY impressed by this and it is comforting to know that if I do have any problems it will most likely get resolved quickly.Here is my wishlist of features I would love to see.  Not a lot, but just thought I'd throw it out there:1) Okay, there is one thing that Apple DOES do better than this player.  They have the option to play audiobooks at double speed.  I don't truly get a 2:1 speed, but it speeds things up about 25-40%, significantly reducing the time required to "read" a book without distorting the sound of the reader (he or she doesn't sound like a chipmunk).  I'd love it if Ambling "borrowed" this capability.2) I've had Ambling for a long time, and for some reason I thought this had a widget once upon a time.  Am I thinking of something else?  If they did, I would love it if they brought it back.  If not, I'd love it if they added one.  Something with the basic features (play, pause, skip forward, skip back, open program) since 95% of what I do with an audiobook does NOT require the full-screen program.3) I'm not sure if Amazon would allow it, but if it could tie into the Amazon Cloud Storage that would be AWESOME!The bottom line is that if you are into audio-books then this is a MUST HAVE program for you.
3	B004L67EJY	Thank goodness we found this. We love audio books, but nothing out there would play the chapters in order without alot of work. This solved that problem.
3	B004L67EJY	Really like the great selection of books and fair prices.  Will buy more audible books.  Very easy to use and got my questions answered quickly.
3	B004L6EDH0	This app will be very helpful for my work. I like that it does not give too much detail about each drug. When I am working I just need a quick description, and this app gives me just that.
1	B004L6EDH0	Nothing special you can get same and better info, on other pharmaceutical apps.  But it does what it says covers psych drugs.
1	B004L6EDH0	this app contains s somewhat thorough index of psych drugs, but hardly ANY info on them. it's really little more thsn a list. and much of that info is inaccurate. specifically, info on dosages is largely incorrect. it is a tragedy that amazon does not carry the epocrates.com app because that is much better than anything on the amazon market.
3	B004L6EDH0	I've got this one on my iPhone too! Lots of great info here that is well organized and easy to use. Don't know what I'd do without it!
3	B004L6EDH0	its a good app to have in case you'll forget what was the medication for you can look it up with this app its a must have on your device well needed
2	B004L6EDH0	I will keep it for awhile. gives list of common psych drugs to read about but it is very limited. If I find I am not really using it, then I will delete it.
1	B004L6EDH0	this app only describes some of the psych meds and their purposes. no information on drug interactions or combined effects  Too..basic to  be useful.
3	B004L6EDH0	This application is a good reference tool for those who may need to administer psychoactive drugs and need to know more about them and their effects.
2	B004L6EDH0	Although this app is useful and very informative, it lacks details. Doesn't include side effects, potential hazards, and specifics on what symptom does it treat. Nevertheless I think I'll keep it.
3	B004L6EDH0	I love that you can look up all psychotropic medication by name as well as by generic. That is very helpful.
1	B004L6EDH0	Very little info. Not worth the space and not enough information or variety of info. Whats with so many words in a review?
2	B004L6EDH0	Thought I would use this more but just wasted space for me personally.For me it was okay just didn't use.
1	B004L6EDH0	I deleted this product within fifteen minutes of loading it. It is not at all intuitive and at times very hard to use. Searches were slow and at times did not work. Try Med-scape. Much better product much easier to use.
3	B004L6F2T8	While psych terms are certainly changing over the years, it&#34;s still nice to be able to look up unfamiliar terms. This app goes beyond depression and bipolar to explain things I had never heard of (or wanted to).
2	B004L6F2T8	Program contains definitions for basic psychological terms and words. It also includes short bios for the more common psychologist and psychiatrists.
3	B004L6F2T8	if you are into psych or are taking classes this can help out. has good deffs and has everything i needed to look up
3	B004L6F2T8	Wow, looking forward to using this, very nice. I wish the definitions were a bit more depthful and encompassing/including of more connotative meaning and common usage perhaps... such as Oedipus complex usually referring to a male who actually is to some degree still behaving from being fixated in a stage of psychosexual attachment to the mother... etc? But this app is very good &amp; useful, and I'm gonna be using it a lot. Thank you for this!
3	B004L6F2T8	I have used this app in my nursing class and it has helped tremendously. I would recommend it to anyone!
3	B004L6F2T8	I have now started doing my psych class and I know that this will come in handy for the terminology!!
2	B004L6F2T8	This is a nice little application for an intro to Psychology terms. Clean interface and quick and does not bombard you with ads. Nice for nursing students who need to do a psych evaluation on a patient and need some help with psychology terms.
3	B004L6F2T8	This app is like a dictionary for psychological terms. However, it could have been better. It was quite bland; definition could use more depth. But I quite like it for being handy and convenient in my kindle, and also helpful.
3	B004L6F2T8	I have fibromyalgia and the information is wonderful. I'm keeping this information on hand for my doctor to see for sure.
1	B004L6F2T8	When I tried to open the program, a big notice popped up warning that the program is corrupted and could possibly harm my device if I opened it...so I  immediately removed it from the device.
2	B004L6F2T8	As an MDS nurse and involved in the Care Planning process this app can be a handy tool.  Sometimes it is good to have a quick answer at hand, thanks!
3	B004L7KGFC	I just loaded the free trial this morning, or, yesterday morning, and I have downloaded tons of songs on both my android devices to listen to offline and save data-usage.  Very good quality, lightening fast speed, impressive selection, and I would have THIS as my only source of digital music, if I had found it first.  Does it all.Now, as for how it plays well with my PHONE, I didn't get the download to work yet and may  need to try the mobile version.  Too busy enjoying what I got to bother with it yet.I will definitely be paying to keep this little gadget around.
3	B004L7KGFC	MOG is an excellent app! I LOVE THE ABILITY TO USE ON AND OFF LINE. I use at home online and with my tablet offline when away from WiFi access.
3	B004L7KGFC	I am so in love with MOG and I am so glad I discovered it. This app is a MUST for all music junkies like myself! I can get new music as soon as the Album comes out and I love always having the latest music out there as well as my favorite old-school hip-hop,r&b and latin music. My fiancee is Jamaican and has been able to fill his system with all his old raggae music that he has not heard in YEARS, he couldn't believe that all his music was right there and in one place. I can even get my medition music on MOG, you can never get tired of discovering new music on this App. so well worth the 9.99 a month! The only thing that could be updated is to be able to choose multiple songs when you want to delete them from the "Play Queue"...
1	B004L7KGFC	I downloaded MOG because I have had the service for 2 years on my Iphone. Now I buy a Kindle Fire so I can get MOG on Android thru Amazon, but can't find it to install. So I own the Mog app, pay $10/mo. For MOG service, and CANNOT EVEN USE IT!!! This app is useless on my Kindle Fire. Can anyone help me tweak this app to work on kindle fire??? HELP!! Don't know if I should cancel MOG OR RETURN MY KNDLE FIRE!!????P.S. I LOVE MOG MUSIC APP ON IPHONE!!! BEST MUSIC APP EVER!!!
3	B004L7KGFC	love it so others will read,  apparently since this came pre installed amazon app store will not do updates on it.  anyone else?I am as well put off because it is not free as stated, they need to be shown what free means free / see detonation below.As well as it appears MOG is a Google app,  because it does update thru Google. and many of the games I have gotten that did not work when downloaded and installed thru amazon,  work when downloaded thru Google?Adjective Not under the control or in the power of another; able to act or be done as one wishes. Adverb Without cost or payment: &quot;ladies were admitted free&quot;.
1	B004L7KGFC	Good music app that won't work on the Kindle Fire, possibly because it competes with Amazon's Cloud Music? Cloud Music has no streaming radio options. :(
3	B004L7KGFC	VERY NEAR CD SOUND QUALITY (320kps).  No other streamer is as good.  If you play music through anything other than earbuds, you should use this. The Android App is not as good as the desktop version; however, there are advantages like searchable playlists.  You can't do as easily on a computer as you can on this app. Sync is easy and the vast majority of pop & rock songs I've ever searched for across a wide selection have been available.  Classical selection is very, very good with great recordings of almost every work you would want to hear.
3	B004L7KGFC	Why pay Spotify(its main competition)$10/month and NOT have the ability to download and keep the music..Other services are out there that let you stream but do they let you keep your files local or are they on the cloud?....which btw only works when you have a signal...so forget about going on trips...MOG lets you download at 320kbs on wi fi which ensures a nice clean sound while you also have the ability to share to ANY platform(twitter..facebook..etc..)...I love this app but whats keeping it from 5 stars is the lack of a landscape mode...
3	B004L7KGZC	Update: those of you with Smugmug know that SM is forcing us to change formats within the next 2-4 months. I already have switched, and now the site will not display "properly" (is at all) on the three Kindles we have. The gallery thumbnails might show up, but not the page, and certainly not the home page. I've taken one star off, and I'm thinking that this may have to be 3 stars if this isn't corrected.****Original review:  SmugFolio is as good as the folks who brought us SmugMug to begin with. I have an extensive web site through SmugMug with more than 3,000 photos of birds, bugs, bunnies etc. I love that I can access the galleries and get thumbnails just as I set them up. SmugFolio, in my opinion, however is for viewing rather than for arranging or editing or anything else that I would only do on my PC. I love my Kindle Fire, but I use it primarily for reading, It is a tablet, but I don't need a tablet. SmugFolio may have many other features, but I use it for viewing. There isn't much else I can do with just a home wi-fi. Now, if I were willing to spend a small fortune every moth to have Internet access, then maybe SmugFolio would be even better. Then again, if I had Internet access from anywhere, I could just go to my web site. While it IS one of the better apps for photography that I've bought, I just can't see doing all the things that SmugFolio allows you to do on a phone of tablet when the only way to work with a boatload of photos is on a "real" computer.
1	B004L7KGZC	Awful logo!  I wish I had waited a bit more because now I don't know how to delete it. HELP!
3	B004L7KGZC	so easy to find and show my photos. the photos load quickly and look great. and the app has many useful extras.
3	B004L7KGZC	Does what you'd expect it to do - browse your smugmug photos, albums, categories, etc.It's not really as fast as you might like, but it's about the best thing going for smugmug users who have the kindle fire. It's worth the price - until smugmug releases an official app for the kindle fire or their official app is allowed on the kindle fire app store. If the official smugmug app were available, this app would NOT be worth a look.
1	B004L7KGZC	I can't seem to easily get registered on it.  I have the password from my daughter-in-law, but I still can not see the photos that she has posted.
3	B004LE24PK	These quotes are indeed motivational. Some of the quotes are classics that everyone knows and others are new to me.
3	B004LE24PK	So many amazing quotes from some amazing people...I highly recommend this book. Quote for every feeling and every day. Awesome!
3	B004LE24PK	great app to put on a kindle. easy ti use and does not take up much memory. fun to play around with when time allows.
3	B004LE24PK	everyone can relate to the quotes. i like to use them to help others feel better. sometimes they even make my day a little brighter.
3	B004LE24PK	fun to have a motivational quote every day. I send it to my mom and aunt via sms as well. it is a must have to get your day going on a good note.
3	B004LE24PK	Nice app, I love the quotes...very uplifting....but.... I agree with some of the other viewers, those annoying stupid adds at the bottom really does suck and definitely takes away from the app in general.  Also, I was under the impression you could post the quotes directly to facebook.  If that is the case I sure haven't figured out how .....
2	B004LE24PK	This a good  idea that helps me communicate with my grandchildren. All the kids in the neighbor an relate to most of these Quotes.
1	B004LE24PK	I downloaded this app and did not like it, so I thought I removed it completely from my account, but I guess it is still in the Cloud. I do not consider this app to be very motivational at all. Would really prefer it to be totally removed from customer buying options/selections altogether!!
2	B004LE24PK	Who wouldn't love something motivational you can grab at a moments notice when you need it.  I appreciate the persons who find the quotes because they take a lot of time finding things that mean something special.
2	B004LE24PK	Motivational Quotes come in handy and I like to look at Famous Motivational quotes. I would enjoy more famous Motiovational Quotes.
2	B004LE24PK	Just wasnt what I was looking for. So don't go by my review. You might like it, again it just wasn't what I was looking for.
1	B004LE24PK	Personally, this was not a motivational app. I was not motivated by the quotes and I felt they were a bit generic.
3	B004LE24PK	While I was still home during Christmas break I had downloaded this on my new kindle fire HD, and I started reading some of the quotes to my mom and who would've expected this but we started getting into very meaningful discussions about the roots of some of the quotes. It was sort of a bonus bonding moment w/ my mom whom I'm already very close to, but to be able to express our intellectual views and go back and forth w/ some of our thoughts on these quotes was a very special moment to me.
2	B004LE24PK	these are nice quotes but cant share them, what good are quotes if you cant share them with a friend.but if you need uplifting yourself this will do the job
3	B004LE24PK	Has a decent database of great motivational and inspirational quotes.  Great for one of those days when you are a little down and need a quick boost and also nice to share with friends.
3	B004LE24PK	I like to read these to remind myself to stop worrying about the small stuff.  Plus it makes me seem smart when I re-quote some of my favorites.
3	B004LE24PK	This is a pretty good app, but some of the quotes seem to pop up often, like they have to throw them in with the daily rotation to fill out the day. It would be nice if there were quotes from more modern day notables too.
3	B004LE24PK	I wasn't certain I would use this app but I do.  I don't read it everyday but when I do I read several at a time.  Also, it has motivated me to do other reading (of the sources quoted).
2	B004LE24PK	if your looking for some uplifting motivation quotes this book didnt have many bad ones in it. Also had good ones I wrote down myself
2	B004LE24PK	I love motivational quotes so figured I would give this application a try. Some of the quotes were ok, but all and all an application not worth keeping so I deleted it in less then a week.
3	B004LE24PK	I ran across this when I was browsing through various apps for my Toshiba Thrive Android tablet. It is a simple app. It does not do anything but give famous motivational quotes. However, it is free. I love quotes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to have things to think about.
3	B004LE24PK	Good quotes to read and share. It's nice to be able scroll ahead or go back to find something you may have missed. Works great on my Kindle Fire.
2	B004LH12MI	Although not tried yet, I cannot honestly assess this app until having walked through its attibutes. So I will give this app 3 stars until I try it later... I am usually pretty good at deteriminiing what apps are really good apps for usage. So it safe to say that having downloading this app, chances are, that its a good app and the rating should go up.
2	B004LH12MI	Most of the apps by Michael Quach are okay. It depends on what you're looking for. Basically, these are just motivational quotes.
3	B004LH12MI	I have a lot of medical issues and I have used this app several times and sadly, I'm afraid I'll be using this a lot in the future .  Oh well, it answers my questions and that's what's necessary.
3	B004LH12MI	I had a infected eye and the arc remedies  wear great and one week with out a trip to the Dr my eye was fixed
2	B004LH12MI	... I haven't actually used it yet.  I hope to do so and this review should be more helpful... as of now, don't know.
3	B004LH12MI	Very cool app! I enjoy the random and interesting facts and cross referencing them with my medical dictionary. Very cool
3	B004LH12O6	Its ok, but I'm &quot;14&quot; (12) so it didn't help I mean I don't know if its the age or the app.
2	B004LH12O6	This is a very nice app, but it is very limited. I prefer lightening bug, but I cannot find it for the Kindle Fire.
2	B004LH12O6	I originally reviewed the wrong app and cannot figure out how to delete my review of this product, so I'm simply modifying the review to be neutral. I don't remember using this app, which probably means I was unable to get it to work and/or I found a different sleep app that worked better.
3	B004LH12O6	this really works! i could never get to sleep but now I can. works better than any others ive tried. I'm using it right now!!! \( 'o')/
2	B004LH12O6	I uninstalled this because I kept hearing short patterns of static repeating -- quietly, but -- anyway it distracted me enough I gave up on the app, which otherwise had seemed promising.
1	B004LH12O6	I tried this application I have used and still do another with binaural sounds but this one gave me an extreme headache not good at all
1	B004LH12O6	This sucked and was NOT worth the time in downloading it even as a free app. Fix your stuff please and make it more fun!
3	B004LH12O6	WHOOO HOOOO!!!  I have been studied brainwave entrainment and neurofeedback in a class about a year ago and can across this little program.  Can't say whether or not it is really having a positive effect, but I can at least say that it is not having a negative one (as far as I know).  If you want to do something like this you should talk to a neurofeedback expert, one with an actual psych degree, not just a certification, just to be safe.
3	B004LH12O6	which have been reported to improve relaxation, meditation and sleep.  This is one of the few relaxation or sleep machine apps that offers these binaural and isochronic noises incorporated into the nature and relaxation sounds.
3	B004LH12O6	I was looking for applications that could help me relax and fall asleep.  The desert sunrise on this one is a nice choice.  Played low on my Sony Headphones I could begin to relax and calm down.  Since this is a Lite version there are only two options.  But a nice way to try it out.  Works well on my Kindle Fire.
3	B004LH12O6	I was very surprised at the soothing sounds.  This really does help me get t sleep faster and sleep deeper.
3	B004LH12O6	Tried this on my kindle.  Downloaded it in desperation when my 12 year old son was going through a spate of sleep deprived nights.  It relaxed him in ten minutes.  Not as helpful for the 10 year old, but better than melatonin.  As for me it has been the ace in the hole when insomnia stalks me.  The acid test was this morning when I woke at 4:30 am from a nightmare.  normally, I'd resign myself to getting up.  Strapped this app on and I was able to get back to sleep.  Amazing.
3	B004LH12O6	This rests my mind like nothing else.  I've had it on my itouch for over 4 years and now it's on my Kindle.  I haven't noticed any problems.  To the kid who wants this to be more fun,  go to bed already!
2	B004LMX032	The app constantly freezes and restarts itself so much that I ended up uninstalling it. Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars. I would attempt to open the app on a daily basis and almost everyday it froze and restarted which prevented me from using it. This would happen multiple times in a row before it corrected itself.
3	B004LMX032	I like the many features of this app, plus the detail of the horoscopes is pretty good.I liked it.
3	B004LMX032	Not bad app, just giving it four stars, because you cant view your horoscope unless you are close to WiFi or internet. Butt does come close to being accurately. Gives you yearly horoscope.
1	B004LMX032	It's wack. I erased it to make more space on my kindle. Don't bother uploading. The horoscope is cheesy and I couldn't relate.
3	B004LMX032	I have to say I like this Astro Horoscope very much. It is nicely done and put together quite well. Can not see why anyone wouldn't like it who likes Astrology . It is entertaining.
1	B004LNXV30	When I first downloaded Shopkick I liked the app. It was very addictive. Now, for the past week, I can't get it to find my location. I've tried wifi, going outside, nothing works?? The last upgrade made the app unusable so I deleted it and downloaded it again, now I can't use the original version either. Contacted  creator twice, no replies. Using a Samsung Epic Galaxy.
1	B004LNXV30	This app does not work. I downloaded but was never ever able to open it. Use the Shopkick app through Google. It works great.
2	B004LNXV30	So this is a rewards app. You gain points (&#34;kicks&#34;) in 3 different ways, by entering a store, by scanning bar codes of certain products in the store, or by buying certain products using a linked credit card. Points vary by store by item and by day. Sometimes you can walk into Best Buy and get 200 points, other days its only 100. Not alot of stores participate. The closest mall to me only has 1 store that will give you points for walking in (American Eagle usually 35 points). The next closest mall has American Eagle, Macys, JC Penny and Best Buy.The app knows when you &#34;walk in&#34; to a store based on the music that is playing in the store. So you may have to go to a part of the store where the music is the loudest. Also if your not connected to internet (wireless data or wifi) you won't get credited. The app uses your GPS to find out whats close to you but it does not use GPS to determine that you went into the store. The big problem here is when internet connection is spotty. During the christmas season, so many people are in the mall that connecting to the mall wifi or using wireless data  is very difficult. many times I missed out on kicks just because I couldn't connect and thats using my 4G LTE phoneThe app gives you a &#34;daily kick&#34; of 1 point just for turning on the app once a day.  Now for some math, a $5 gift card reward costs 1250 kicks and a $25 gift card costs 6250 kicks. So the value of each kick is $0.004. Thats less than half of 1 cent per kick. So the daily kick they give you each day for opening the app is useless (if you get 365 daily kicks thats worth $1.46). The most I have gotten for walking into a store was at Best Buy 200 kicks which is worth about $0.80. So walking into stores isn't all that valuable, what about scanning and purchasing. The value of scanning things varies wildly, at Target scanning a hershey bar gets you 10 kicks ($0.04) and scanning a 12 pack of toilet paper gets you 150 kicks. Buying items at target get you 3 kicks for every $1 spent (thats like 1 cent cashback for every $1 spent. Bottom line your kicks aren't going to add up very fast.While it is nice that you don't actually have to buy anything to get rewards using this, your not going to get huge rewards either. Its worthy of 3 stars, its just ok
2	B004LNXV30	WHEN it is working! It is almost impossible to update, scan and earn kicks and sometimes I can't even collect kicks upon walking in the door of each place! incredibly frustrating! Droid 3
1	B004LNXV30	Downloaded this app for my Archos 43. Tried it for a day and every time I tried to run it got an "oops" error, try again later. Uninstalled. Nice waste of time, and the company hasn't bothered to reply to my inquiry
3	B004LOB25S	This game is like none other. What other app let's you choose your mood as well as action. This has brought me hours of gameplay. But it can be pretty sad...
3	B004LOB25S	it had me in depression for weeks. it was just so sad for me. and the price should be at least .99 instead of $5
3	B004LOB25S	This app is great. I have led a great life in the both times I've played. I can't finish the game though because as I try to get married the game stops. Please fix.
1	B004LOB25S	seriously this is a really fun game but 5 freaking dollars when I can play it for FREE on the Internet!!! seriously people.
1	B004LOB25S	I bought the thing but now it wont download!! super mad right now... I guess Ill just play it online...
2	B004LOB25S	I really enjoyed the game.  I hope they expand upon it.  for example longer middle adult with the ability to aquifer more wealth..grad school...jobs that have different salaries...etc
3	B004LOB25S	I havent paid to play this one on here but you can play it for free online. Just a hint to save your money. :)
1	B004LOB25S	I really do think it is a neat game,but for a sensitive person like me, it made me cry. Tons of the stories are sad,and not really what the game says it id. I eouldn't call it a game, more like an interactive story,I deleted it after I was about half done,in my opinion it wasn't worth five bucks.
3	B004LOB25S	I love this game but the price was ridiculous.  once I bought it there was the same game but for $2.99 and the cheep one was nowhere buy appeared AFTER you bought the expensive one.
3	B004LOB25S	I really love playing this game online(FOR FREE), but when I don't have WiFi, I can't. Lower the price or make it free, please..
1	B004LOB25S	I have played it online and it was good but I wouldn't get it at this price. It does have some sad stories so don't get it if your weak of heart.
3	B004LOB25S	I used to play it on my commodore as well. I love it and glad I found it on here.
3	B004LOCSYC	It is a fairly good app, since it was free. Although I wish it was more descriptive and a general picture of it, even if the picture was black and white.
2	B004LOCSYC	I love the idea of this app it teaches you the various purposes of the common herbs everyone knows, but my take is that not all might know exactly what theherbs might look like and would like to match the name with image, also the app constantly crashes on my device. Hope the glitches are fixed soon then I can give a full 5 star rating
1	B004LOCSYC	this app leaves out a lot of common herbs and is in accurate mostly. thee os a word minimum and that is why I am still typing.
1	B004LOCSYC	This app really had the same herbs that you see in every store and in most books. I thought it might say something different about each herb. But it was the same as what I've already read. If you are inexperienced in herb then this would be a good app for begginers.
2	B004LOCSYC	like the title implies, it is a little rough around the edges.  Michael, put some more work into it, and come spring I will purchase the full app.
1	B004LOCSYC	Attention Developer: I would gladly PAY for this app  if you would:1) Include more than fifty herbs. Alright, that's exaggerated, but many, many common herbs are missing.2) Cross-reference these to ailments as the user below suggests. It's an app - it should do something more than a booklet;3) Include the magickal correspondences.As it is, there wasn't enough information to really warrant it - I just went ahead and bought a book on herbs, which I can read on the Kyros. Which yes, this at least does work on.
2	B004LOCSYC	Lacks pictures need pictures of each herb plant for easier identification.  An okay boook if you are already familiar with herbs and what they look like. Contains some informative reading.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is one of the best programs out there. It is simple and reliable, it is what I want.Evernote allows you to store notes, pictures, and audio recordings in a cloud-like environment accessible from anywhere on most devices with a connection to the internet. It might do more but realistically this is all i use it for.And it excels at it.Primarily I use it to store lyrics. Other lyricists can attest to this: You will inevitably think of some cool line at the most inconvenient of times and it is very important (perhaps to none but you) that the line get written down or recorded as soon as possible. Previous methods of walking around with a notepad in my back pocket proved useless, for one I didn't ALWAYS have it (i don't always have my kindle but I do almost always have my phone which has evernote as well). Also, if your phone explodes in a fire, provided that the last sync is up to date (and the program syncs often) you will loose no data. The ability to record audio is very useful as for my purposes I may also not only want to remember the lyric but also the melody.I'm not quite sure if it shares well with other users, I may have tried it once but it may not have been super easy or obvious and I didn't have the motivation to look into it. Regardless, this program seems geared toward a single user anyway and that is how i use it; any music/lyrics/etc.I do with a group seems best managed (as of now) by drop box.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm a big fan of Evernote, and use a paid account to access content via the Internet that I may need wherever I am...regardless of what device I happen to be carrying.First caveat: I primarily use then fire as an entertainment device (ebooks, cloud music player and "second screen" browsing/tweeting/emailing while watching TV), and I consider Evernote much more aligned with my productivity act ivies than leisure ones.The 'droid/Fire version interface has some aspects that make it less intuitive than the one I use on desktop and laptop. While some of this is expected due to smaller display space and no mouse/soft keyboard, some of it provided challenges that made me feel less comfortable as an Evernote user.Nevertheless, I'm keeping it around because I've become accustomed to the convenience of having access to my Evernote-stored content wherever I have Internet connectivity.Others have commented in alarming ways on the permissions required for install, and especially the access to contacts. I checked the Evernote blog about this and found it specifically addressed there, and found the outcome of this permission to be benign AND useful:"Read Contact Data: This is used to allow the Android application to access your contact list in order to autocomplete email addresses when you email a note. We do not share your entire contact list with the Evernote Service; this information is used exclusively to send emails."
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have and iphone and a kindle fire and a laptop, and I.have Evermore on all three. I love it because I can make a note or journal entry or anything and it syncs too all my devices. So if I make a note on my kindle and need to check it when I'm out, then I can just pull it up on my phone. Makes life a little easier, and isn't that what an woo is supposed to do :3
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app to take notes, create notebooks for them, and share my notes. I think it is a great app to use. I really haven't cared about the permissions, but it is a great app to take notes on and write with.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use evermore for everything. As a writer I am always jotting down short notes for ideas and tweaks. thanks to evermore, I always have those notes with me be it on my Kindle, phone, or computer. I just discovered the dictation feature last week and have been using it extensively!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I do not know how many times i have made up a 'to-do' list or reminders and then left them behind. No more. They go wherever i go.  I can keep track of books i want to read, and check off the books i've finished.  I easily keep track where i am on projects for clients, or web pages i need to read through at another time.  I've even used Evernotes to keep track of medical events/statistics that need to be shared between specialists, or created check-lists of prescriptions i need to have renewed.  My husband can easily add to our grocery list, even while i am in the store. This is a wonderful convenience that i use daily.  And for free, no less!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is the greatest app I have on my Kindle Fire. I have it linked to all my devices and it makes taking notes, saving ideas and even directions easy by syncing with all my devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app to track my hydro vegetable garden.  I can keep track of my progress with text, pictures, or sound.  It will also automatically upload your notes so if you have to wipe your phone it's all neatly backed up.I also use it for grocery shopping lists but that's not it's strong suit.
3	B004LOMB2Q	evernote is a great app to share files with many different devices.  i use it with my work, home computers and my kindle fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	best application everlove the syncing.love that you can use it on a kindle.great for making shopping lists
1	B004LOMB2Q	I found it somewhat difficult to import files that are important,,and retrieve notes or reminders,,no alert function I could findI don't know,,i haven't given it a real look,,just a cursory exam,,I didn't like the opening,,so I reserve my opinion at this point,!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	So far it is great, easy to use and auto-sync between phone, kindle, and laptop without any problems. Recommend for anyone needing to keep track of activities.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Enjoy this app. It lets me jot down my thoughts quickly and easily.  When I want to process my thoughts a little more deeply, it doesn't matter where I am,  I can just log in and vada voom vada bing... I can.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app keeps my stuff in order. Downloaded for both my android and now my kindle. Can't imagine living without it really.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Device: Kindle FireI love the app Evernote  itself. It is one of the easiest amd best taking note apps you can get. Except for one thing- I discovered this app has viruses. When I ran a full scan of &quot;Dr. Web Anti-Virus Lite&quot;, it showed that Evernote had a virus
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app allows you to create notes like a journal entry but its safer and easier than writing because you can access it on the ipod computer kindle phone so you'll always have it even if one of those gets damaged it lets you upload audio pictures and videos to save and help create many of your memory's this app is fun and easy to use so if your looking for a nice easy free journal app then stop looking because you have just found the right one I am always looking to find an nonlinear journal like penzu and other apps but this one is by far the best!!!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	It has a really smooth interface. I've never had problems with it crashing. You can take notes, add pictures, and add sound recordings. Evernote Corp. Even has a drawing app called Skitch that allows you to draw a picture for your notes if you need it. I use it everyday and I would recommend it to anyone who needs a reliable note taking app that allows you to look at your notes from virtually any device with internet access.
3	B004LOMB2Q	great app! Still learning all of its capabilities but I love what I have used!I love how it syncs with my home computer and you have all of your files wherever you go.
3	B004LOMB2Q	wonderful! what is so onerous about the terms of service? this thing is helping me to get more organized than i've ever been! and free free free!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Loving this application. It's so nice to have my notes available from all of my devices. The ability to have multiple notebooks to organize my notes by category is a nice feature too.
1	B004LOMB2Q	am removing it from my kindle today ... it is the most time-wasting app ... it is confused and confusing, too .... do better!
3	B004LOMB2Q	wish here was a link button, but like that you can save anything: sound, text,  pictures!  helps keep my mind organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Absolutely the best thing since - well, um, homemade macaroni and cheese!!  I can use Evernote and sync all - pc, phone, and kindle - at once.  This app have been my most used, most loved, and most recommended app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	between computer, phone, ipad, and kindle all of my notes are there and I don't lose paper. Evermore is withme where ever I am.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote in general is AWESOME!  I use it to keep information from the web as well as a Diary,  &amp; pictures &amp; recipe's,  whatever you want to keep, no more piece of paper everywhere and it is sooo easy to find what you need quickly. You can have it as organised as you want.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I absolutely love this app and I recommend it to everyone. It's a great way for me to make lists and notes regardless of whether I am af work on my computer or using my Fire or Android phone. It's also a great tool for my wife to send me a shopping list.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I always read reviews before I use an app. But I usually go to &quot;See All Customer Reviews&quot; then choose &quot;Newest First&quot; because those reviews usually give you the most accurate idea of how the app works now.This app seemed to be highly lauded. It's supposed to have an &quot;easy&quot; user interface. I'm a homeschooling mother of an autistic son with a kindergartener in school. I am converting our lives from &quot;traditional&quot; to what can best be described as all natural. I also suffer from a joint disorder so there are lots of doctor's appointment to keep up with for my son and I. Right now I have a gigantic wicker basket full of binders and folders to try to keep my household managed. I wanted something easy that I could use that would keep track of EVERYTHING, that would allow me to take photo memos and voice memos. This seemed perfect.However, the interface is NOT user friendly. It won't let me delete notebooks. I have four emails in my inbox asking me to connect to my computer so it can &quot;sync&quot; which I'm wary of. You can upgrade but it's not a &quot;for life&quot; type of upgrade that will sit in your Amazon Cloud Drive until you die...it's a subscription.I think that it should've been made clear that this app was really geared more toward a business person who can write off a monthly subscription. I have a tight budget. I don't mind paying $4, $5, even $10 for an app that would give me the functionality that I need but not a monthly subscription.This just isn't a good app even though it has all the features I need because it's really just a trial before you get the subscription. I'm hoping I can get my stuff off here before I delete it. If you can afford the monthly subscription, I'm sure it's awesome.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'fe used Evernote for years on my ipod touch and Pc so I was glad to install it on day one on my Fire.  Great for quick reminders and web clips.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have improved my ability to keep my commitments because my notes and action items are with me all the time. When I'm in the office I log my call and meeting notes on my laptop, in the field I use my tablet, and then I can bring any note up anywhere in 5 clicks or less using my phone.  I have never been so organized before.  This is the solution I have been looking for!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have just recently started using Evernote, it has performed beyond my expectations. I have it on my phone, computer and my Kindle Fire. Everytime I use it I learn something new. I have had no problems. Syncs with no problems. I really like that you can create different notebooks. I am planning a vacation and I created a notebook just for that. And I have created other notebooks.  I recommend it. It's awesome!
3	B004LOMB2Q	i like it. it's one of the few note-sync'ing app that support blackberry among other platforms. i have it running on my pc, bb 9900, kindle fire, kindle fire hd, and bb playbook.2013-04 Addendum: My wife is an Evernote-convert now. She has quite a collection of recipes on Evernote.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i love that i can make  notes, see them like virtual post its and edit from any device, anywhere i am,  offline or on. great simple app for teachers to keep track of the bajillion things to do, say and think. i write notes  while walking class to lunch etc, no more getting to the end of  the day and drawing a blank only to panic when  it all starts coming  back at 6am
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app, feel lost when I don't have it - which recently happened w/ old kindle dying.The privacy concerns are troubling, and main reason I rate 4 stars instead of 5
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm only giving 4 stars because this app isn't quite as user friendly as I expected it to be...I'm new to smartphones and tablets so sometimes I need directions simplified or visually demonstrated.  It seems to be able to do much more than I am able to get from it thus far (about a month of ocassional use).  Still, I'm keeping it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Incredible app.  Evernote is one of the greatest things I have ever discovered.  I couldn't manage my life without evernote.  The ability to be reminded of everything, the ability to search everything, and the ability to save everything and have access to it everywhere is just incredible.  I would highly recommend evernote to anyone I know.  Also, the premium features are by far worth the $5.00 a month.  You get much more storage, the ability to search inside office and pdf documents, and the ability to mark up documents just to name a few.Give evernote a try...you won't be disappointed.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I rely on Evermore for SO many things. It's never let me down. I love this app. It comes with security, ease &amp; satisfaction :)
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote to capture my thoughts, recipes, webpages, makes lists. Very helpful app. Syncs to multiple devices. Use it daily.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use it every day on every machine in my world. still amazed it is completely free everywhere. thanks f
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this between my Fire and my phone. I write lists and notes that I need to take with me on the Fire. Then I have them on my phone. I can put important docs from laptop to Fire. I use it a lot.
3	B004LOMB2Q	ive looked for months for an app that would do what evernote does.... I use it for diary entries and its perfect
3	B004LOMB2Q	I wish this program worked with a Stylus with the Kindle fire (any of them)!  It's a nice app, however I want to use it in a meeting where I can write things and not type them.  The nice part of syncing the notes is great if you forget the device you were working on and your somewhere else needing the information.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I would recommend this to everyone. I use it all the time and have confidence in it to the point of telling everyone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	keeps all my notes and favorite qoutes on all my devices and its free. love it for my kindle most have
3	B004LOMB2Q	... on every device and PC I own! Evernote is one of the first apps I install when setting up a new device. It's very useful to make some note, save some bookmark or pic and be able to access it whenever you need it again.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is amazing.  You can load your data, pictures notes etc on your pc and have the cloud update your device.  Or vice versa.Everything you need is available.  You can load files and access them anywhere.  There is a scratch pad that you can write notes or type notes.  it has a mike to do voice commands.  So far it has done everything i wanted it to do.  And there is a prime that you can buy,  But so far I haven't found the need to do that.  If i find I have a need for the prime, it is something I would definitely do.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is one of the most useful apps i have, its compatible with all my electronic devices.  When I take notes on my phone and I dont have to worry if my computer crashes, my phone acts up where I loose all my info (Ive had that happen where Ive had to recreate my notes from memory) because of this multi-tasking app I can look upthose same notes on my Kindle, on my computer and my phone instantly. Now that i have the new Kindle Fire HD I can use the front facing camera to take pictures if needed, for my project.  If I could give this app 10 stars I woulf
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a fabulous app! I have it downloaded onto all of my electronics and I love how it will synchronize so that I can have my notes instantly no matter where I am or what I'm using.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is a great app. Have it on multiple devices.  Works great and I recommend it to anyone who needs a virtual note pad.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is an outstanding app.  The keyboard size makes it easier to write on the Kindle than my phone and make notes easily. Best of all, it synchs with all my devices. I love it and highly recommend it for busy people who like to stay organized!
3	B004LOMB2Q	To sync with desktop app you have to sign up for paid version but OH this is a necessity if  you have learned to lean on Evernote in the desktop environment.
3	B004LOMB2Q	very good app. like the way it downloads on all devices. keep up the good work. like all that it offers you.
3	B004LOMB2Q	very handy app for staying organized with your notes. the only thing that could make it better is a calendar.
3	B004LOMB2Q	What I have enjoyed most about Evernote is the ability to share info with my husband.  If I remember we need groceries, I can create a quick list and send this to him. He then has it and can stop on his way home from work.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Wish I had played with this more but was put off by what looked like it requiring net access all the time unless you bought the subscription monthly/annually. I have to switch my access off at work and wanted to be able to review/ makes notes/checklists in folders. Been a long-term user of ColorNotes but always wished for a folder system to group items together. Found Evernote then dismissed it thinking it wouldn't work offline. But it does...and it rocks. And Evernote suggested Skitch app too, which is fun and useful. 6  yr old daughter loves that fordrawing over photos and WHAM, Evernote loads them up to cloud, makes it easy to share them via email, social network etc. It may take me a little playing around to work out all of Evernote's features but now I know it will work offline, I am totally game to try...
1	B004LOMB2Q	with that aside, I do like the general functionality of the app for the most part. the first bonus listed on the go premium is that u can see your notes offline, but as far as I could tell, you can anyway. which is good; if I cant access my info offline, I wont bother using the app at all.  In comparison to springpad: evernote has cleaner, easier to use features. springpad's notebook page is better looking and u have a social feature where u can follow other notebooks; I did not see that on evernote.  evernote has a few 1ups over springpad, but I wont use it anyway because I don't see why it would need access to so Much personal information.  I find it absurd esp when they just published in TIME magazine that they wont misuse or sell your info or ever flood us with ads... so why do they need our contacts and private info?
2	B004LOMB2Q	I hate creating a very useful rich text note, and not able to edit it on the mobile devices. it let's me open the note if I append it copy, but that's not rich text editing.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is my go yo app to save all my recipes. It is easy to use &amp; I don't have to get out the laptop when I want to cook or share something. I have this app on my computer, aneroid phone &amp; Kindle Fire
3	B004LOMB2Q	great note tool.  clipping is awesome and phone widget makes photo notes super simple. premium adds a lot of value, but try free first.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have spontaneously gravitated in Evernote over a period of 18 months or so, in the press of coping with projects and courses in the hurly burly of life. Latest thing was it made scanned images of book pages searchable.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have only used it a few times, but so far so good. It's great for keeping track of goals, lists, and ideas that just pop in your head while on the go.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I was using springpad but could not find a springpad app for kindle fire.  Evermore is perfect for rememberinng web sites across my devices.  I save sites photos and notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I got this app to help keep all my list together now I use it for everything.  Syncs between two computers, my phone and my Kindle Fire.  Love it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app all the time. I have it on Mg smartphone and I really love how my phone and my fire auto sync with each other. great for keeping notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	First off, I feel the permissions are relevant to the app, and the app capabilities. That said, the app is very helpful for my line of work, and my busy life. I forget everything, and I am constantly making lists for different business ideas etc. I like that you can create different notebooks, and that you can easily fullback and forth between the books. I could go on, but will not since there are thousands of reviews. Just love it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I really like the idea of this app. I added evernote to my kindle fire hdx and to my laptop. the problem that is happening for me is that they are not syncing together. another thing that kind of pissed me off it that i couldnt get word documents to transfer to evernote. so anything from word that i wanted on everynote i had to take out piles of time to redo onto evernote, instead of being able to just transfer over. copying and pasting works, but only to an extent. if you have a certain format going you can forget it, its not going to keep once you paste it over. it might now be a problem for everyone, but if your ocd like me its going to drive you crazy. also on the app when i go into note they are a little too blown up and there isnt a way to zoom out so that everything fits on the screen without having to drag over to the left and right to see the whole page.. hopefully these are all just minor issues that will eventually be solved with update. I really do want to like this app, it could be very helpful
1	B004LOMB2Q	This never worked out for me.  I originally had it on  my computer and used it a lot actually.  I used it to put articles and things aside until I could get to them...But then it just disappeared one day.  When I saw it for the kindle, I downloaded it, but never used it because I didn't have the functionality that it did on my computer...so, I got rid of it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use it for college, my medical information, and even use it to save recipes and craft instructions. I have it synced with my pc, my browsers, and  my kindle. I love it
1	B004LOMB2Q	too intrusive. wants too much access to my personal info, and i see no reason this app should need it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app to keep organized across devices.  I use this on my computer and phone. works awesome and syncs flawlessly! great new additions with screen capture. love this app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	It just need to cheaper or totally free to be the best one! Highly recommendable to everyone to keep all your notes connected and synchronized
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm using it mostly as a journal and I love how I can it across several platforms, mainly Kindle Fire, android phone, and desktop computer. It's fairly easy to use too.
1	B004LOMB2Q	That is terrible that they need all of those permissions so I can take some notes... Most games don't  need that many permissions. Spyware!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This really cut down on paper work. I can carry everything with me now. Very important papers and reminders right there at my fingertips. Yay!!Thank you
1	B004LOMB2Q	Was disappointed in this app. Was not what I expected it to be. I found something else that works better.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this app on my pc and love it. The version on the kindle fire is limited but I can Still use it for most thinks. Thanks so much!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app that can help the chronically unorganised to save lots of time - it 's all here - you don't have to search for your stuff,  it 's all here.  since you can find it,  you can do what needs doing,  so fewer people are giving you a hard time for forgetting...
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've used Evernote and Astrid for quite awhile for work and home and they are almost like business partners to me. Evernote's flexibility makes organization easy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	love this app but I hate the constant syncing wish I didn't have to be apart of it if it was in the background
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great way to keep track of grocery lists, to do lists, and much more.  It syncs from computer to phone, so I always have my lists with me.I began using it without reading the tutorials, so my rating is based on my using it so far.  It does lots of other things that I have yet to use.  I am sure I will give it another star once I learn to use all of the other features it offers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great way to sync all your thoughts and ideas from all of your devices. Now I don't know how I can live without it. My personal and work life can be put and pulled up from one place.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Amazingly easy to use. I never have to worry about losing or misplacing a note. I can take a note on my cell then bring it up on my tablet or Pc and god knows I misplaced things. especially important things.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just started using this a few weeks ago, and as someone who is new to this kind of flexibility, I am finding it both easy to use and fun.  Thanks, Evernote.  When/if I ever need an upgrade on this kind of note keeping, this app is the first I will reach for.
3	B004LOMB2Q	At first I was reluctant to use this app because of the privacy concerns raised by several reviewers. I painstakingly read the whole privacy policy and couldn't find anything that said they would use or not keep private my data. Those reviewers were misunderstood, Evernote said that if you post to THEIR WEBSITE or a public folder in Evernote's program will be public, not your private data from the program, heres a little bit:"Certain portions of the Evernote web sites and services are open to any online viewer, such as user notebooks designated as "public," and our user forum. Any information that you post in these locations can be read, collected and used by anyone, and could enable others to send you unsolicited messages. Evernote enables you to determine whether or not to post personal or otherwise sensitive information to publicly accessible areas of our site, and so you should carefully consider how you use the services."And they just sent a notice of the updated privacy policy to come in 2013 and highlighted these points:Your data is YoursYour data is ProtectedYour data is PortableI haven't read it yet, but highly doubt they'd mislead us into thinking it was private and then bury some line about it not really bring private deep in the policy.I am spending all this time writing this because I actually read the whole policy and was upset I waited so long to use this great service after trusting the reviewers who thought Evernote can basically just hop in your private files and do what they wish. Evernote lets you save notes, webpages, scans, and keeps it all organized and accessable. And it seems to keep getting better, there is now an Food edition, (wonderful news for a foodie like me) where you can keep track of foods you eat and love, I can't wait to try it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is one of best apps I have ever used.  Between syncing my notes across my devices and being able to share notes with other people, it is the perfect program for college students on the go.Simple to use and note sharing saves hours of time!Everyone in our house uses it for anything from shopping lists to keeping all of our notes and references for my college classes.Works across multiple platforms including Kindle, android phones, and desktop and laptop computers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have tons of information that I need to access at the drop of a hat, and evermore does the job! A simple, easy to use layout with all the functions I need make it one  of my fav apps
3	B004LOMB2Q	At first I only thought of this app as a notepad, but it has so many other uses. Overall, an amazing app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I take message notes at church with Evernote and it is quite useful. The features appeal to every personality and it is easy to use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Ignore the haters. get this app. you can use it for whatever. but I use it for a journal... it really does help get your feelings out. I have never used a journal but I like this. so thanks for making this app. give this app a shot! ^_^
3	B004LOMB2Q	Useful in too many ways to list. Anything you need to save online and/or add notes to comes together perfectly in this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It's great because it works with skitch but accessing the notes could be a little easier. Maybe in the future?  Still worth it though.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I  installed this application when I needed a note app for my class. After seeing these apps how they work :ColornoteSpring padI found myself enjoying this app more. If my kindle ever breaks down, I never have to worry about my notes because Evernote always syncs up my notes on the computer. I love this app!!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is such a great app.  I had to find something new after Google Keep deleted some of my important data (moved that note too close to the edge of the page and bam!  It was gone forever with no hope of return).  Evernote has stored my notes across my PC and tablets.  It provides handy tips to get the best use out of its features.  There are lots of ways to organize notes and other items.  Best for me, it checks to make sure I want to delete something before removing it--no more lost notes!  The more I use this app, the more I appreciate its clever features and usability.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have tried other note apps but this is by far the best. I love that it integrates over all my devices. I like the ability to click on web pages and save them and that it uses photos and voice options. I would highly recommend.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app because it kinda created a little website with everything you need to save. I just had to click on &quot; save to evernote&quot; and it would save my pictures from fwarp, skitch, and my picture folder. You just make a title and write any extra things.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This does what it says and the notes are easy to print out no completed things to do just click to print or edit a note.. I like the fonts very nice selection great job Thanks Evernote Group
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote extensively for my notes at home. I have about a dozen notebooks that allow me to define different contexts.I have used Evernote at an outdoor concert, for journal entries, recipes and so on.Now, I also use Springpad for work and business related notes.  That way I get to experience the best of both worlds.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love this app. I can now take notes at meetings without dragging my laptop all over the place. Well worth the cost.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app helps me take notes in class. it slows down the more notes you have saved though. I like it
2	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is a nice notebook app that has decent functionality. For Apple iPhone and MacBook Pro, it's your best choice.  One comment though, it pales in comparison to MS OneNote, whose functionality makes Evernote look like a 'lite' version or OneNote's little brother.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I think this is a great app. perfect for daily notes :) I use it to remind me of certain things I need to get done, and recipes and so on. I love that you can make more than one notebook so you can keep your notes organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love working with evermore across all my devices to keep notes in one place. Keeps up with my life when I need to note something.
3	B004LOMB2Q	very useful for keeping my household in order. great organizational tool. i highly recommendthis app...I replaced my microsoft onenote with it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Ever Note is an amazing app to store notes, recipes, to do list and many other items. It is very easy to use. One of the best note taking apps out there!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great utility that let's me store, revise, and improve my ideas.  It's also a great post it note replacement.  I cannot say enough good things about Evernote.
3	B004LOMB2Q	it is a great app I can organize and delete any no good anymore note I recommend this app highly
1	B004LOMB2Q	I never used the Evernote. I no longer have it on my tablet. I never used it period therefore I cannot like or hate it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	By far my Favorite APPI have Evernote on my Laptop, Tablet, Cell phone, iPad and what and when ever I use it on any of my devices. It will automatic update to all my devices.I have my grocery list I createdI have a shopping list I createdI have all my medication listed and simply open the App at the doctors office and they can check all my prescription I take.I have travel logs I keep on here with directions, hotels, restaurants, etc.This App is free on Tablets, cell phones, and iPads.
3	B004LOMB2Q	If you use a lot of different devices (and I do), and you want to jot down ideas wherever and whenever they strike you (yep, this is me) before they escape your overloaded.brain, this is an awesome app. Was taking a break working on a jigsaw puzzle which gave me an idea for a novel I'm working on; was able to jump into Evernote, write down my idea and attach a photo of the puzzle. Very happy there's an app for my Kindle fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've got Evernote installed on every device i own and it's been a life saver!Having my notes and whatever else i want always available no matter what device im on is great!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Never have to call my husband again with a shopping list. on my phones, computer, and Kindle. even has my emergency info on it!  Love it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am able to sync my notes with my tablet, phone, and PC. I love the convenience it offers! Highly recommended!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote to gather bits, segments, pages, images, notes, guides and ideas and then actually organize, access, and manipulate the data using either\all of my notebook PC, desktop PC, Galaxy smartphone, Kindle, and anyone I may choose. It's one of the few flexible and useful applications I've ever used. Plus: the price can't be beat.My computer programming and user experience began with punch-card computing on shared, super-expensive  monster IBM's and the origins of the PC - pre-PC microprocessor implementations to the present. (Wow! What a ride so far!) I'm eagerly anticipating the future of the Industry. Evernote will be my choice for simple gathering and organizing diverse data for any end use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I started using WordPerfect when it was in Version 4.2, and Microsoft Word when it was a cranky baby. In fact, I have the distinction of being one of the very first users of some of the very first word processors, back when the concept meant a fancy typewriter that could record and words and then allow very minor edits (A thing called the IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter, the MTST).Evernote is a worthy addition to this motley group. It is by no means a complete word processing application, but it can handle most everyday needs. It can be used to make a shopping list complete with check boxes, write a letter, take notes for a class, maybe even write a book. It has the ability to add emphasis through underlining and italics. You can even start a project on your cell phone, work on it on your tablet later, and finalize and print it on your computer because everything is saved to the web.I won't say it is my first choice if I'm sitting at my computer. I'm too solidly sold on power for that. But I do appreciate being able to make my shopping list and then send it to my husband who will pick up some stuff on the way home.As you will have noted, this is a free app. There's also a &quot;pro&quot; version that you can pay about $50 a year to use. I haven't bothered because I'm no longer working so my needs are far less.This is a nice little app, and I think you might like it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is an awesome app! It's great for productivity! I hats writing reviews and I will never write another one (okay never say never) but I owe so much of my productivity to this one application, I couldn't say no when prompted.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this on my kindle, phone and laptop.  Not sure if I'm doing it right.  Certainly is not user friendly.  Love the idea, but frustrated when my note did not get from my computer to my phone when I needed it to.  Probably user error.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I think this is a very useful program. There are a lot of features I am still learning, but I am finding ways to use it personally and professionally. I wish the kindle allowed speech to text notes as other platforms of Evernote allegedly do.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Fantastic app. I can't imagine a life before Evernote. How were we ever productive before syncing all our notes and ideas across all platforms?
3	B004LOMB2Q	i use it daily to do things like voice memos, ammend study notes and capture free floating idea..  for the individual trying to compute in a cloud environment this app is indespensible.  my notes are with me from one device to another and the changes are all in sync.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Great app for organizing and keeping track of things as they happen, however the terms clearly states they can use,  modify and distribute anything you upload for purposes of the site and sell to partners. Again, GREAT app... not worth it to me.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Works great for the many things I must keep up with. School, two businesses, church meetings and personal things like bills, appointments and grocery bills. I just downloaded so I need to learn more I'm sure.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I've been using this app for ages with no problems. It's installed on my Evo4g, iPod Touch, PC and now my Kindle Fire. The problem is - The version offered in the Android Market is version 3.4.2 while the version in the Amazon App Market is version 3.2.2Even after removing the app from my phone and installing the older Amazon offered version, the app notifies constantly there is an update available. Yes, but not here on Amazon! This is also causing the notification to appear on my Kindle Fire. It's become so annoying I'm ready to look for another cross platform note taking app.I keep my life on Evernote, and love the features. It's been great to snap pics through the app on my phone and have them instantly on all my devices.I don't understand why it takes Amazon so long to release updates, especially from trusted, tried and true productivity developers.I don't want to give up on Evernote, but the false update notifications showing up on my android devices is getting really tiresome and old.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I found that this allowed me to see documents on windows, ios, and Android with no problem.  Something I had not been able to do in the past.  The index in the application also makes it easy search tool as well.  Nicely made application.  Well worth trying out.
3	B004LOMB2Q	As a developer on the Microsoft stack, I tried really hard to like OneNote.  I really did.  It came installed on my Windows Phone and is one of the components of Office 2007 Ultimate which I won in a drawing at a local .Net users group meeting.  However I never really got the hang of it.  Sometimes it would sync the phone and pc and sometimes not.  Then I tried Evernote.  I have it on my personal desktop PC running Windows 8, Samsung Focus Flash running Windows Phone 7.5, work PC, and my new Kindle Fire HD.  What I enter into one automatically shows up on the other three.  I like it a lot.  Plus it's simply easier to use!
3	B004LOMB2Q	My experience is positive so far. I'm only using a small percentage of its tools, mostly because the user videos are so vague I haven't learned how to use them. I like the connectivity with other users. Sharing notebooks is extremely useful. And having all my personal notes / data is one place is great.  I am likely to upgrade....
3	B004LOMB2Q	evernote is wonderful ! i keep all my recipes in it. i have them all divided into notebooks for beef, bread, chicken, etc. and i can access it on my kindle, laptop and my iphone.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I was so overwhelmed with what this app could do that I jumped right at it, created lots of notebooks and notes. It does the job pretty well so why did I get bored?? This app just lacked color. IT LACKED LIFE. It wasn't visually entertaining. Everything looks dull with the black font. A highlighter could have been useful. Make it stand out more. I found that while I was reading with it, it got pretty boring and dull. Even though I got my notes organized, they all look muddled together. All look the same. Not that exciting anymore. A little color won't  hurt anybody. Just saying.
3	B004LOMB2Q	They need to fix the butt ugly iphone version. Hoping they don't roll out the ugly as he'll iphone version for kindle.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I installed this on my daughter's tablet, her computer, and my computer.  This gives her the chance to do her writing at any location and to keep her stories synced together.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is amazing I was looking for a writing app for school and there was none that were good but when I saw this one - and skitch (another app created by evernote Corp) - I got it and I never deleted it. I highly recomend this for every one.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app for keeping track of all different things. I can make my shopping list, create a quick note, take a picture of something I may want to find later. In short, great orginization tool! I have deleted several other note apps since downloading this one. I just don't need any of the other ones.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Now with Evermore, I can write them here, than copy, cut and paste in an e-mail or on Facebook. I no longer yell ugh! When I lose a long thought out note
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've loved it so far, having used it for about two weeks. My only complaint and reason for for stars instead of five is that it occasionally locks up my kindle fire.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I have friends who absolutely swear by Evernote.  They always cite how much they love how it crosses over well from all of their devices.  Personally I much prefer Color Note.  Maybe this is because I only ever used it on my Kindle Fire, but I just don't get why they all like it so much.  It seems pretty average for this type of app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app like a journal as well as for notes. I love this app. I will suggest this this as a great app for memory keeping.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love Evernote. I'm. using the free version. It is a very easy way to sync notes between my tablet and PC. The only complaint that I have is the upgrade process on my fire. I receive upgrade notices everyday but had to wait for the upgrade on the kindle store. The notice didn't contain an upgrade button.
3	B004LOMB2Q	With easy and simple tools, and nonlinear access to your notes on any device, this is a great app for keeping track of everything!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Really one of the most useful app across operating systems. Most useful for remembering umpteen numbers of notes and different info you need. The photo ability means you can even carry info in non supported fonts by photographing them.
3	B004LOMB2Q	How did I get by without it. Great app for taking notes. One of the best I have downloaded. And everything is synched across all my devices.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I can't find the application on my Kindle and I don't know how to get help.  Can you help me?
1	B004LOMB2Q	for me it did not work on kindle fire hd because it required a phone number might be great for a smart phone
2	B004LOMB2Q	It pretty nice so I keep notes on work I have to do, but I get so many notices telling me I have one new update. Infact, after I updated it today, I'm already getting a notice that there's a update for it! Quit updating non-stop please! But it gets 3 stars from me.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I can save and pick up materials anywhere and have them to use for my. collegestudents quickly and easily
3	B004LOMB2Q	The software works well. It does not require a lot of tedious setup. I love the convenience of having all my notes available from any device.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It'll save bookmarks, notes, and so much more.  Great for those who do research since you can highlight the info. you're looking for &amp; access you notes from any c.computer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm loving it!  Actually posted on Facebook to get feedback from friends who used it.  Love the notebook set up and that I can use photos.  I set up a notebook of business cards, took pictures, and cleaned up the kitchen bulletin board and purse!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is one of the best note taking apps on the market. I tried doing without it for a few weeks and it was difficult. The other apps I tried to use to replace it just cannot compare.Top of the list is ease of use. Evermore is intuitive and has almost no learning curve. It allows you to organize your notes the way you want, or need to, and therefore is as flexible as you need it to be.
3	B004LOMB2Q	evermore is a must have. yes if you are using the kindle fire there may be things you can not use but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get this FREE app. you can upload images, write notes plus if you use drop box or another syncing app you can post documents off your computer onto it. give evermore a try. its FREE..
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is the end all be all of note taking apps in my opinion. Not only does it sync all of my notes to my pc and other devices, it also does it in a very aesthetically pleasing way. The app is always using screen real estate to its fullest and the colors are amazing.There isn't much else to talk about but the UI because the app is centered around just the UI itself.
3	B004LOMB2Q	been using evernote.for a while now on Pc, kindle, iphone, and now on android phone.  great app to keep notes handy to access anywhere.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Finally, the app that turns my rambling, wandering, unfocused Internet habits and endless curiosity about millions of things into a trail of breadcrumbs that I may easily follow.Now I don't have to sync bookmarks, check. my notes, email, phone, etc.All the info is always available all the time.I cannot believe it took me so long to adopt this!
3	B004LOMB2Q	evernote is the best ever I can take notes anywhere at any time it never messes up it is awesome I keep up and everything.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is the very best organizer/ note tracker/ file saver/ cloud storage around.  It can be loaded on ever device, incduding the PC and items are always available no matter where you are.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote simply works perfectly across my tablet, phone and PC.The sync feature is outstanding.This is truly a &quot;must have&quot; app
2	B004LOMB2Q	installed on a kindle fire hd 7, free acct,upgrade to premium, limit on notes, access notebooks offline, additional mobile security ie,pin to lock account, 1gb boost uploads, search pdfs, doc search,share notebooks, larger note size of 100mb, note history, if this is important for you, go for it.needed a basic note keeper, can sync auto and wifi, can search offline w/o network, can take pictures, usage resets in 24 days. not sure what that is.will continue my search for a note take with limits. lol
2	B004LOMB2Q	I really like the app but I hate the permissions!this app is good but I really wish I could get that read clearly app on Amazon... all well
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like it. The interface is often a bit over cluttered and slows down my productivity with the app. It has, though, emerged as a good tool for hanging on to notes, web couplings, and other sundries for later use or incorporation into another medium. As such, it is more of a secondary tool than a primary productivity app for me. Appreciate its overall stability. Not as unpredictable in delivering on its designed functionality as other free apps tend to be.
3	B004LOMB2Q	having a crossplatform and available anywhere digital notepad has become indispensable.  I may never need a pen and paper again!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love that I can save notes, email them to my friends and family. I can even post to facebook!!
2	B004LOMB2Q	Helps me keep jobs at work/home in line.  Day to day or hour by hour.  Limited only by location in woods, signal strength.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is the best app to share between my iPad, iPhone, and Kindle Fire. Sharing documents with different operating systems. Droid and Apple. With the PC app its complete. Wonderful! Keep up the good work Evernote. I' m a big fan.
3	B004LOMB2Q	it is very useful and easy to useit helps you save reminders for laterit is also very organized
1	B004LOMB2Q	I wanted a note pad and a reminder. I find this program very confusing and have to push many buttons to find what I need.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a very useful productivity app. It taps into my Evernote notes so I can find everything from a grocery list of stuff I need to pick up on the way home to offers to buy on guns that people bring into the store where I work.  I am disappointed that Evernote does not offer a native Linux application, but the Google Chrome browser extension plugs that hole somewhat and this app can thus synchronize the notes entered on any of my other computers.  No issues whatsoever.  Its one of those apps that &#34;just works&#34;.
3	B004LOMB2Q	With owning a smartphone, a tablet, a desktop computer and a laptop; having all my notes gathered in one place and accessible anywhere I am is invaluable.I share notes with my husband, and friends when I'm online. I have memory issues and I use Evernote for little things like phone numbers given during the course of a phone call, I can just grab my Kindle Fire (Android powered tablet) and save notes to myself without hunting for pen and paper.Because I am physically disabled, I can't write,  but typing on a tablet is easy and Evernote helps me remember all the little things.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have been using this app to journal because that was something I always wanted to do. It works out great, it's easy to edit and I can even add my fav pic of the day!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is great for note taking, obviously. But what I like most is the intuitive organization. My favorite feature is he ability to sort your notes into different notebooks, and then you can view all he notes together or sorted by notebook. Great app that is easy to use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This evernote app is very simple: it let's you take notes and organize them into particular notebooks. You may also take snapshots as notes with your phone's camera.The main aspect that makes this app so appealing is the interface. It's very clean and easy to use.The basic free version has 60 kb (kilobytes) of space. That's good enough for typed notes, but will not be enough for notes with photos.Overall, one of more solid note android apps available. Take a look.P.S. Make sure you read the user agreement before installing. There are some intrusive aspects that may concern some people. I don't mind though.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A very nice well thought out app, although i do like this one i prefer a different app for my note taking deals
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have Evernote installed on all my devices, with the sync feature I can add or update lists or take notes on any device and view any where.  I have never had any problems with the program.
1	B004LOMB2Q	There is so much lag between here and the real market.I'm just about done with Amazon due to this issue. It's not just this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	The first app to install after the built in Android apps. Also install the Windows application. Perfect for remembering everything.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is absolutely wonderful application, love the fact that it's portable, it's intuitive, and easy to use.  It is on every device I own, and I can't think of living/working without it!  Great for collaboration too!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this program on all of my devices. It is a life saver for me with all of the different applications I have manage and remember settings for way too many computers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I totally recommend Evernote, in fact I kinda made my wife get it. I like to use it for jotting down notes and also for anything else like a blog. What can I say Evernote is awesome
1	B004LOMB2Q	I have used Evernote since about 2010 I think.  I don't think I could get along without it.  I used to use it on the iOS platform.  However, I recently went to the Android platform using a Kindle HDX 8.9 and it now removes all of the formatting in my notes.  I can have wonderfully formatted notes made on my PC and iOS devices.  Some of them years old.  But, once they touch my Android device they are ruined.Prior to this I would have wished I could give Evernote a 10 out of 5 stars.  Evernote has become my right hand.  But, since moving to a Android tablet (Kindle Fire HDX 8.9)  Evernote has been a nightmare and support has been silent.  that is Evernote support not Amazon.UPDATE 5-20-14  The title of my review used to be "love it but..."  I finally heard from Evernote support.  Apparently they will not support the Kindle version of the Evernote application.  They wrote that It is fine for me to read my notes in the Kindle version but they recommend I do NOT attempt to edit my notes on the Kindle.  They wrote the Kindle version will only operate in "many ways" and it will not be supported or updated.  This is incredibly disappointing.  As I wrote above.  Evernote is my right hand.  I am a stroke survivor with memory and cognitive deficits.  I have come to rely on Evernote and my phone and tablets to keep notes and photos as part of my lost memory.  I try to stay objective in my reviews.  But, this actually makes me feel physically sick!  Losing Evernote on my Kindle is as if I have lost part of my memory again.  Amazon had to know this when I emailed them and they emailed me back.This is a link to the email Evernote sent me.  You will have to copy and past it into a browser.http://1drv.ms/1ob463T
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like that I can jot a note or write a book and have it on each digital piece of hardware I've got.  Easy to navigate.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is such a helpful app. However- I prefer an alphabetic listing- not one by date.I particularly appreciate that it stores info.So-if you have to change devices you don't have to start all over again.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Maybe I'm too new to this but I'm finding it rather difficult to transfer info &amp; picts from one page to another.Everything else seems great as far as I've seen.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app on a Kindle Fire HD but the reason I really love this app is because I'm a desktop user too and the desktop version is killer.  The great thing is evernote keeps all my notes synced up so I can see the notes and notebooks I made on my desktop when I'm away from my desk using my Kindle.  I almost didn't try this app because it wanted me to create an account.  I've used this for 30 days and when I started to write the review I realized that I had actually made more notes at the desktop than at the Kindle.  At this point, I find the desktop version a little more intuitive than the Kindle adroid app but then I have done so much more with the desktop version.  I've  added clipped selections of web pages, I added entire web pages, I've created 20 notebook with 137 notes, I've took screen shoots and added them to notebooks while I was installing a surveillance camera, I created grocery and to do list with bullit list, numbers, and checklist.  The checklist have little boxes rather than numbers and you can go back and put a check in them.  30 days is important because you have a 60MB monthly upload allowance for 30 day unless you go premium.  Premium is a monthly charge not just a different app.  Just for personal notes the price of $5.00 per month ot $45.00 for individual was too high for my use.  I really saved a lot of webpages, screenshots, clippings, pictures, and notes over the last 30 days that I normally would not have done and I still only got to 34M of my upload allowance and after the 30 days my allowance was reset to 0.  There was one firmware upgrade during my 30 days and I installed it and all my notes and note books were still in order.  There is so much more to this app both on the Kindle and desktop that I haven't touched but I'll be seeing how much more I can kick the tires over the next 30 days.  This is savng me so many of those little notes you write at your desk and I can still see it all when I'm at the Kindle and evernote keeps it all in sync for me.  This app almost makes me wish my tracfone was a little smarter so I could use it on my phone too....back to noting...if I have more after the next 30 days I'll add that.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evermore daily in my business. If you run a small business, this app will be valuable in so many ways!
3	B004LOMB2Q	The ability to protect a note, which is not in this application (you have to pay a recurring fee in order to protect your notes), is a deal breaker. Too bad as I liked it. Went with AK Notepad instead which allows for protection of notes without having to pay for the privilege.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use it for all my lists. I am a bargain shopper so I use Evernotes to keep track of four different shopping lists. I use Evernotes to recall future programs and dates. I list important reminders of events and jobs needing to be completed.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is installed on all our devices.  No more sticky notes. No more coming up with a good idea and then forgetting it. No more &quot;what did we need at the hardware store&quot;. Try it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	the more I use it the more I find ways to use it. and on every platform I use. windows, web, iPhone, and now aneroid.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evermore as a gratitude journal; a place for recipes; ideas for articles to write; reminders -- and I use it all the time.  One of my favorite apps ever.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Ok, I am taking courses online and take tons of notes.  I put all the notes into evernote and they sync to my computer where I can use them to write essays, etc.  So many uses for this app.  Just found gsyncit will sync outlook notes; many other apps provide other functionality....
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote for many different lists. Appointments, shopping lists for different stores. I've stuck photos in it on the fly. Very easy to use and I can access it from any of my computers. I mainly use it on my Kindle Fire as it's the most handy to post a note/reminder to myself.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is definitely one of the easiest ones. they have made this so convenient to use over multiple platforms and devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i've been using this app for a little over a week on my Kindle Fire &amp; i'm quite pleased w/it thus far. it allows me to compose &amp; organize my thoughts/writings in a way that embraces &amp; facilitates my intuitive way(s) of expression. i also dig the way the app syncs w/the nonlinear account.the fact this is a free app is quite impressive &amp; greatly appreciated. i highly recommend it.NOTE: check out the Skitch app (also free) too work drawings into your Evernote experience
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have had evernote for some time but I didn't fully understand the usefulness of the program.  After hearing  so many good things about the app I finally gave it a try.  I'm giving it a try and so far I am finding EN pretty is  pretty cool
2	B004LOMB2Q	It is okay but it keeps bothering you to send password so you can enjhoy it on all your devices. I did not w\really want it on all my devices just my latest one.  I have never used lit yet, so I do not know if it works as it says.
3	B004LOMB2Q	[...]. for those worried about saftey and who owns what. I used to use a simple notkeeper but this is much more organized, and transfers to different devices,and computers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love this app. It works across platforms Android tablet, PC, Android phone etc. , sync's easily and is a great way to keep miscellaneous notes, lists, etc.  I use it for shopping and task lists, quotations, work related notes and personal info.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is one of the most useful apps out there. the uses are endless and it's soo easy to use. I give evernote a 9 out of 10 scale. thank u evernote Corp for this software.
3	B004LOMB2Q	We use this to stay organized and finding it works great for us.  It's easy to set up, easy to link to everyone's computer or Kindle and has a ton of options we can use for assignments.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Although I am not using it to its fullest potential I love the fact that I can add to my notebook from anywhere -- home computer work computer or kindle.  I've started using it at work to save ideas for improvements or long term projects I can't work on right away.  Very versatile.
2	B004LOMB2Q	This app was easy to install, easy to use. It just did not do what I was hoping it would do
3	B004LOMB2Q	Clever product. using it to track a volunteer project. I have to add pictures from an outside source. it is best at keeping a historical record. need to spend a bit more time with it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote works on every platform of device I own, MacOS, IOS, Windows, Blackberry, and Android. It's a great note synchronization system that lets you keep tasks, class notes, christmas lists, etc. on multiple devices.Your imagination is the limiting factor of what evernote could do for you. You could put your DVD/Blu-Ray collection in a note to check quickly if you see an impulse buy in the store you think you may or may not already own. I own 3 copies of Terminator 2 for this very reason. The same would hold true for books, music, etc.
3	B004LOMB2Q	its a good app. it does exactly what it says and you can access it across many platforms.  if need to keep notes sync up this app works great.
3	B004LOMB2Q	If you want an app that does pretty much everything in terms of productivity this app is for you. Best of all, it syncs to any device including Pc, android, apple, etc. Very handy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use the Evernote app on my Kindle Fire to work on projects between different computers. It's good for text, lousy for spreadsheets but it's the only app that shares the data in a useful manner.  No other office type app works at all. Google docs ist verboten. Other apps may read docs from other sources but they can't edit them. Apps that can edit create docs that can't be read anywhere else.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app works great on the Kindle fire and the best part is that there is a Plug in for Google Chrome called Cleary that clips out an article right out of a web page packed with ads and sends only the article to the evernote account so you could view it on the Kindle Fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	We have Evernote loaded on all our computers &amp; phones. By far the best way to share info across platforms. Liked it so much that I thought upgraded to the premium version.
2	B004LOMB2Q	App is okay but unfortunately I don't have a lot to sync with and I find this app is not as easy to use as they actually say.  So for me a simple easy to use app is quite nice for me.  I do hope those with a busier lifestyle will indeed enjoy this app more.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote  keeps me organized and l can share my content through all my devices. I can snap photos from within the app and save them in evernote. the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I found it difficult to learn how to maneuver around the site. I think they could have made it easier for the tech challenged. But other than that; I'm loving it.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I can't figure out what amazing things this is supposed to do -- take notes? I also tried to save a webpage using it.,b ut it only saved the URL. And I can't access it without  wifi access or paying apremium price.I also can't get rid of the "shortcut" for it on my Kindle Fire after uninstalling the program.
3	B004LOMB2Q	evernote is one of the most useful apps ever.  u can take notes onur tablet, web, phone , ect and it all syncs.  u will never lose them.  want to look up a note u took down while u were in nyc last week?  evernote evem lets u organize ur notes based on where u were when u took the note.  u can make notebooks for work, home , school, whereever.  evernote rocks.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app. When I first got it, I thought it was just another notepad app. But it was better. You can do so much more on it like add pictures and sort notes into groups. Great app!! :-)
3	B004LOMB2Q	Gotta have this for those to do lists and reminders. It seems like such a simple but powerful note taking app. And best of all it's free. You may be tempted to go premium on it but I don't find it necessary
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have been using it for about a month now and I put everything in it! I even use the email and it works great. Great piece of software.
2	B004LOMB2Q	since I don't use it unless I absolutely need to, I think it's fantastic for what it does. I can't ignore other reviewers' remarks about poor memory storage and new terms of use, but I have yet to use it for anything other than making a shopping list or dumping my brain. and someone said Springpad is better, but I've tried that too and it's not as easy to use or nice to look at.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love being able to write myself a reminder, make a grocery list, save a picture and a arrival link all with the same app. It's taken the place of four of my former favorites.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I bumped with this app and by far, is the most valued for using my kindle. It has brought my kindle fire to be useful and complementary
3	B004LOMB2Q	I absolutely adore this app! It is a great way to organize your things! I would recommend it to any and all of my friends and family members!
2	B004LOMB2Q	I like EN for shopping lists and reminders, especially as it syncs well across my devices. It will bug you constantly for your location, which I have yet to find a need to share. The permissions are more extensive than necessary also, which means I do not use it for anything personal.  We all know now that there is no such thing as online privacy, but some things should be less accessible, so I encrypt them or make them local files, and I use other apps for that.
3	B004LOMB2Q	On my laptop, HTC phone, iPod and Kindle fire; make a note on either one, and can finish it on any of my devices.  a must have!
1	B004LOMB2Q	The permissions for this app were too much for me. I love the concept and interface of Evernote, but I will be finding something less intrusive!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am not a power user of this program. It does some really cool things as far as sorting and keeping track of things like time and place. It syncs so I can use it on my desktop as well as my phone. Unfortunately I rarely take the time to actually take advantage of the various features. It's incredibly useful in spite of my laziness. I have used it to take pictures of things and to keep notes when I am out and notes for things I need to know when I am out. And if I don't name a note it will give it a place and time title.If I bothered to learn all the things it does and actually use them, I am sure I would love it even more.
3	B004LOMB2Q	...that it was clear to me how to import and convert file format into, say, Word or Excel. I will be patient with my own learning curve. In the meantime, A+ for innovation, convenience, &quot;free!&quot;, and Skitch (a very useful and cool thing that was designed with Evernote in mind). TY.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love Evernote!! (If you want to know why they need permissions, go research it)I use Evernote for more taking, web bookmarks, saving news article or web sites for offline reading. So many great things to do, and the best way to use it is just get started and don't stop.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love having Pinterest for my craft projects, and was thrilled to find Evermore, a similar app which allows me to keep up with my receipts, notes, and lists from both my computer and Kindle. The layout is nice, and learning how to use the program was simple! I haven't had any problems with it yet.
3	B004LOMB2Q	So far so good this app is been working flawlessly,I really can't complain about the way it performances. This is a really good app
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a have-to app. Make sure that you have this app. It's amazing. I can do every thing I want to with it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Very handy for everything from contact lists to Web clipping. Easy to use. And it was free at the time - what can be better than that?
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this on my phone, my Kindle, and my desktop. I can take notes from just about anywhere and save them to the same file. It's awesome. You're supposed to use this as a bulletin board and save all kinds of media to it, but I use it for text only: lists and notes and reminders and nothing else.What kind of jeans does my girlfriend wear- are they the ones here that are on sale? Lemme check Evernote. My doctor said to record my headaches? I'll use Evernote to record them and to tell him in his office. What was the name of that band I heard on the radio? Oh, I saved it to Evernote.It has replaced that little spiral notebook I had but could never find.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love Evernote! I use it for everything from clipping coupons to taking notes for the boss. I use their web clipper on Chrome to clip to Evernote, then can add additional notes of my own. I keep a running record of questions for the doctor or things that need addressing with the boss. Very handy and always available cross platform. And they keep updating it too :)!
2	B004LOMB2Q	Good for quick notes. Not the worse that I have used. Good for quick and short notes. Still use on occasion.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Take a note and then take it anywhere you want. this app syncsall of the notes you take with all of your devices almost instantaneously (if there is a WiFi connection. )
1	B004LOMB2Q	Had to uninstall.  I'm sure if they put their minds to it they could provide greater privacy.  But as much as they intend to be in touch with their user base if they made a more private version it would only serve to highlight how bad this version is.It's the Facebook philosophy, take much more than you think you can get away with, and then pull back a little to appease a few people, when enough people complain.  Divide and conquer.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Need I say more?  No I don't think so but I will. why the hell does a note taking app meed every permission my phone have to offer?  it doesn't. try again guys.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Useful, intuitive, easy to use, cross platform, web and computer based allowing sync between equipment. Fire version does not seem as easy as computer version, but is reliable and high quality.
3	B004LOMB2Q	it lets you work on or off line syncs to all devices an allows for collaborative sharing.  what more do you need from a mobile note app?
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've enjoyed using this neat little app. It's really helped me with keeping myself in check on my to-do' s across all of my devices. I recommend it to anyone that regularly uses their phone, and at least one tablet. The audio dictation' s a cool feature too.My only gripe is the account the, and pw setup and restore features are a bit lacking.But besides that, it's a solid app. I've come to rely on it in my daily routine. Lol.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I create docs, notes, and journals that I can refer back to at a later time. I am a IT Professional and it is very important that we keep notes of network and Pc configure. Overall, this app has been a major part in my life.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is the most useful note taking product on the market. It was easy to install on my kindle and syncs up perfectly. I use it usually to take notes for groceries for the girls. My girlfriend is able to see the shared notes in almost real time and can get the groceries I forgot to get. I love it!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Been using Evernote for quite some time. What I love about it is that I can very easily save notes from anywhere - everything's interconnected. Clip from the web, look up notes on my phone, save  to Evernote from practically every app on my tablet.
3	B004LOMB2Q	it keeps me organized. I have it on my phone, my fire, and my macbook pro. I use to have sticky notes everywhere that I couldn't keep up with. great app
3	B004LOMB2Q	There is not enough good to be said about Evernote. I use it everyday, and would he lost without it. It's very easy to learn and you can basically run your life with it.I recommend it for your work, home, school and anything else you can think of!  :)
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just love how I can use this and it syncs with my kindle fire, android phone, and my PC.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love it because there are clients for all platforms, my iphone, ipad,kindle fire, Mac, windows  and nexus 7! allows me to capture anywhere and review anywhere!
3	B004LOMB2Q	A great app.  It sync on the android as well as IOS so I have all the smae information on my iPhone or my Kindle.  It makes life so much easier.  Ina ddition, I did the upgrade.  $45 per year is worth the money.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Anytime I'm in another app and want to email something to my Evernote account, it just force closes with a message that the app stopped working!!! Look, the app was not "all that" anyway!!! Poor text editing included!! Just try to create a document, using bold, italic, numbered lists, bulleted lists, and checkboxes. After you do it, try to use the highlight feature that works on all other apps, and you see it does not work!!! You see the blue circle but it only highlights a text paragraph but not the bulleted or checklists!!! It just like stops like the indented stuff is some kind of picture it ignores and will not highlight it!!!The permissions are over the top too! Now I can not trust it to save my notes with so many instances of them disappearing!!! And they want 50 bucks a year for what, more of the same?? You can not even export the data from Evernote so you are stuck for life paying for the service if you can not import it off in a heartbeat!!  Total overrated ripoff!!!!I will try that Springboard app others recommended and see if it is any better. Colornote is okay but I had instances of trying to export a text list from another app to Colornote and it truncated the list, like it would only accept a certain length, but it was only a list of something that was 300 words!!! Then I tried again and it copied the list. I do not want to have to check this stuff all the time to see if it has a limited or copied correctly every time I want to save or email something.No matter which note app I try next, this Evernote has GOT TO GO!!!!!!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This little app is wonderful if you are an Evernote user. It instantly syncs with your trunk and gives you immediate access to your notes. They layout is just a bit different that your laptop/desktop, but is intuitive and easy to get around. I love being able to access my files with my Kindle tablet!
2	B004LOMB2Q	I do not remember this at all, so I cannot comment on it. I do download many apps and sometimes do not keep them.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I liked this app very much, and used it daily, until the latest update (1/31/2014). Now, it routinely refuses to open on my Kindle Fire HDX, and often I get the &amp;#34;black-screen-of-death&amp;#34;, where I get a black screen and I have to go back to Home to reset. When that happens, the only thing I can do is restart my Fire to get it to work again.Evernote, you need to fix this and provide a new update!!!
1	B004LOMB2Q	Credit where credit is due... Evernote is a fantastic desktop note taking program. Moving from laptop to desktop to office, it is all pretty seamless and the types of input methods available, cover just about all bases.  However, in its foray into the mobile platform, Evernote falls flat on its face.All the great note-taking features found on the desktop are reduced to a clunky, limited and unreliable state on the mobile platform (tablets and phones). Notes frequently fail to save, disappear or simply refuse to sync with the desktop version. Half-baked doesn't begin to cover it.I am actively seeking a replacement product. I can't believe I actually considered paying for this.
1	B004LOMB2Q	This app has a set of very bad (invasive) permissions and the service in general has a disregard for privacy. On the one hand, they advertise Evernote as a way to &#34;Remember everything.&#34; And the question has been asked repeatedly: &#34;Everything? Really?&#34; Look through the user forums and you will see that whenever that question is asked, a very vocal group of &#34;evangelists&#34; rise up and bat down privacy concerns as &#34;paranoid&#34; and &#34;unfounded&#34;. Often, after that a few of them begin moaning about how badly the &#34;evangelists&#34; are treated.If you were to store sensitive information in Evernote (such as credit card receipts, tax returns, medical data including prescription medications, et cetera), you might as well just scan it and post the data on the internet for all to see.Further, by installing this app, you give Evernote permission to access your contacts (why would they need that?), to access and modify any of your data, and generally carte blanche access to your phone or tablet. There is no earthly reason that they need that level of access.Evernote management has dismissed any privacy concerns, stating that they are not a priority, and their rabid userbase can and will attack you for daring to question this choice. The company is more interested in serving ads than serving their users. I even saw a post on their forum once from an &#34;experienced&#34; user who asked &#34;Where did the ads go in the latest version? I miss them.&#34; I have never seen such a bizarre statement. It's like Stockholm Syndrome.I highly recommend avoiding this app like the plague.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Best features are the note books which allow you to organize notes efficiently and categorize your life. The app allows you to sync your data over multiple platforms such as your tablet, phone, out lap top then updates all automatically one connected to the internet
3	B004LOMB2Q	I take a lot of notes and this app is the best I have found so far.  I enjoy the fact that I can use it across all my devices and it still keeps all the notes handy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I read all the permissions issues. It is 2013 and it is free.  Tradeoff is they mine your data. Nice interface on Fire.  Save articles from many sources to read later. Thanks to blog, now using to store photos, notes for projects. Organized which is a personal struggle.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love the ui, I used to use catch, this app is a lot more malleable for my needs even considering upgrading!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I only have the free version. The jury is still out whether or not a annual subscription is worth it or not. The app as is, does everything I expect it to do and easy to use and retriee.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I know a lot of people out there like this app and use it regularly but I have a huge problem with all of the information the app requests that is not needed.  Read the info before you install.  Access to all your contacts and the ability to send them e-mails and so on without your consent.  I deleted the same day I downloaded it.  Have found some that are way less invasive.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I really love Ever Notes and its User Friendliness. While it is very powerful, it is also very easy to use and enhance. Thank you so much for creating it. P.S. I also love the fact that I can have my work on every device I own what a gift and a joy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Took me a little bit of time to get used to making it my &ldquo;go to&ldquo; for everything I wanted to remember, but once I earnestly made a little effort to do that, it worked so well. I use it instead of &ldquo;favorites&ldquo; to remember websites because then they are on any device. But, it's so much more because you can easily keep thoughts or ideas organized . You can copy parts of articles that you want to remember , like a quote from an author.  Bonus- the layout is easy to use and display concise and neat.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love this app, I use it every day. I have a tablet and I love being able to to type my homework on it, so I make a note on my kindle to use on my computer to print. google docs is perfect for documents but evernote is way better for to-do lists and quick notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Helps keep me organized with so many great features. The Skitch component enhances this app and makes it a must have. You won't be disappointed.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just got my kindle fire for Xmas and am fairly new to this, after trying out a few others, Evernote is the one I keep returning to. It is easy to navigate and is very useful along with Skitch.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Easy access. great to save important information needed. copy and paste text fro. anywhere. Download it today and keep a daily log.
2	B004LOMB2Q	Not many options but okay for taking notes which is all I wanted it for. Fairly simple to use. It's an okay little app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I don't use Evernote much on my computer but the App for the Kindle is great! I can keep everything organized!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I tried to use it to &#34;organize&#34; my life like a lot of folks do, but it doesn't work for me, that way.  I do, however, use it to store and organize a lot of information, especially web pages that I turn in to Evernote pages for quick reference (mostly technical stuff&#34;.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I like the ability to plug in notes on my kindle fire and have them available. on my home pc.  however,  I could do the same with my USB connection when I get home with one of the notes apps.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I take all my notes using evernote on my kindle. the only problem is lack of font/ other features one would be used to on word
1	B004LOMB2Q	UPDATE: In addition, after I deleted the app from my device and left it in the cloud, it left behind a hidden folder on my SD card. I had to manually remove it with a third party application. Honestly, this is worth a star demerit but I don't hate Evernote.Pros: I enjoyed typing my notes directly into the Kindle Fire (KF) app, like using a simple word processor. I like that Evernote synched my KF to an insecure web server, to my desktop, and to a web interface. It was an easy way to transfer image and text files.Cons: It was hard to cut and paste text on the Kindle Fire (KF). What I did instead was create multiple notes that I was going to patch together later on a desktop. That is, until I lost one my biggest notes. Now my heart is crying. I'm not sure how much of the sync error is due to Evernote or Kindle Fire's memory, but regardless, the two apps combined makes me wince.Verdict: I just deleted the app.If you're going to use Evernote: Make sure to have a back up version in another app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have been placing recipes and other note worthy stuff in this program. So far I like it, pretty easy to use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Couldn't function without this app.  I use it at home and at work.  I work in a high school classroom and it makes it incredibly easy for me to share class notes with other teachers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like this app. I use evermore, springpad, and another one that slips my mind at moment. but I'm always using evermore on all my devices. I like the simplicity of this app as well as overall layout of evermore.Update...I've been using this app across all my devices, Kindle Fire, Samsung smartphone, Ipod,Pc, and Laptop. I've pretty much stopped using Springpad, due to the fact that Evernote spans across all devices, and the web app works so much better than the Springpad Springit web option.Another plus to Evernote is the growing selection of addons for Evernote. Alot of other apps are using Evernote for collabration between them. The Evernote Vault, i believe it is called has alot of apps for many OS's that are helpful and useful.Now to refer to the TOS of Evernote, it is no different from Springpad, SkyDrive, GoogleDrive, Box, etc. You are storing items in the cloud. The cloud is open for everyone. Evernote does not use your pics, notes, etc for any use at all. This is now a standard TOS for any cloud based service. Take a look at other apps and what they access on your tablet, phone, computer, Ipod, etc. They all access services on your devices. Price of technology advancement.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Works great on the kindle fire. A must app for taking notes and reminders. sync works wonderfully with my desktop.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evermore has a crisp design, fast sync feature, and the best options out there, and I can access my notes offline on my Kindle and PC.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just love  the ease of using Evermore. I can note down notes,  reminders, to do lists,  etc. on my Kindle and access them on my cell or laptop. Cool!
1	B004LOMB2Q	First the good things.  There are Evernote apps available in just about all the app stores, including Amazon, so it's easy to find and install.  It works well with notes you create, and doesn't require installing an application on your computer to view and manage them.The bad news is it does a terrible job with attachments to notes.  The equation editor on my Kindle Fire HD can be backed up to Evernote, but it changes the file name to an internal Evernote GUID, and even changes the file extension to something completely random.  Their competitor Dropbox has no problem with this, so I would recommend using that if you're backing up or sharing anything other than simple text notes.  You'll need to install it from the Dropbox web site because the Android app isn't in Amazon's app store, but it's worth the extra step.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is my must have app. I use it on a daily basis between my computer, phone and Kindle Fire. I like that each sync to one another with very little thought on my part. I was using One Note until I started using Evernote and I've not gone back since.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Ok guy this app is great with orginizing docs. notes ext..  I highly recommend this app for forging people.  Have fun funfunfunn. love that word funnnn
3	B004LOMB2Q	To e mail to others or post to face book.  I was on top of specials ,notes and information I need to remember or share.
3	B004LOMB2Q	really cool and convenient note taking app. handy to use and free and easy to understand. Really advice kindle users to gt this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like the app and use it to log several items like, blood pressure, medicines, measurements of things I need to remember but don't refer to then often.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I haven't had the time to dedicate learning how to use this.  I'm slow learner when it comes to technology so I need time to get acquainted with this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Works great for me so far, but it constantly requests update downloads, and now I see that the terms &amp; conditions are quite invasive; they can use or sell your notes or uploaded info at their leisure to promote their app. Considering uninstalling this just for THAT reason.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use it for EVERYTHING. It makes things easy to store and easy to organize and EASY TO FIND a month later.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Use it on my computer and my Iphone for saving information, recipes and directions and patterns.  Would recommend it if you are into saving information without printing it out immediately.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love this app. Very convenient across platforms. Everything updates automatically - fabulous!  I have been using this app for several years and it is have never been disappointed.  Go go go go get it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is so versatile, I love it. I even have it as an app on my Google chrome and on my HTC phone. That way everything is synced. I love using the web clipper on my Google chrome too for evernote. I also use Catch notes. Would like evernote better if they would do their note selections horizontal rather than vertical. It just feels odd sliding it side ways on my kindle. As there isn't really enough room to see them right. Other than that it's great. My wish, if evernote could look more like catch notes, and they would all sync together. But I love all my note apps, and I'm happy. I also use skitch with it. All their apps are great to use together, or by themselves. I love the colors of their apps too, that is a main reason I chose them. Not like ones that are blue or other boring colors. Or that have tiny fonts you can't read. I would like to change to different fonts in evernote. Maybe some day they'll let you do that.
1	B004LOMB2Q	The calendar does nothing. I want one to keep appointments and can't seem to find one that works with KindleEvernote, can not get it to work eitheras for right now I hate the Kindle.
2	B004LOMB2Q	Kindle cannot keep up with the Apple apps.  The Moleskin is one that I would love ... but it is not available.  I will keep looking for a similar counterpart.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I waited a while to rate as I am still learning how to use this program.  Let me start by saying I am far from a techie.  I have 5 computers and a couple of them are dinosaurs and none of them have the same OS.  I have Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 7 Starter on a mini-HP, Ubuntu and a Kindle Fire, oh and a Droid phone.  In other words, I am a hot mess. I have used Microsoft Onenote for several years, I love it and I really didn't want to learn something new.  I was frustrated because of sync issues with my trusty onenote and also, I couldn't get Onenote on all my computers so I started tinkering with Evernote.  WOW.  Loved it almost from the start but still missed onenote because of the familiarity I had with it.  Now you can get onenote from the cloud and I am torn about what I am going to use going forward.  Still I give Evernote 5 stars because it is a super cool tool for organizing all your stuff.  I read that some folks have privacy issues with Evernote.  I guess I just feel that everybody is data mining and there is no way to avoid it unless you stay off the internet.  My 2 cents.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is great for taking notes on the go from nearly any device and/or on the go.  I use it all the time to remember how I set things up at work so I can duplicate it exactly later on if need be.I use evernote on my iPad, iPhone (work), my android phone (personal), macbook pro, kindle fire, and a thinkpad.If I had to manage my notes between all of those devices myself, I'd lose my mind and probably some of my notes as well.
1	B004LOMB2Q	way to many permissions and invading your privacy and it should not be able to read the data in your phone
3	B004LOMB2Q	THIS IS THE BEST APP EVER!! Oops, said that in all caps. This app is extremely useful and it should cost money, it's so good. I recommend this app and every other app by this developer! Again, very useful and very organizing!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this for work for notes and screen captures. Really love the automatic cross device sync, as I use it on my Kindle Fire, work laptop, and Android phone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app does a lot. A lot of ways to keep ur notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love this app. Very easy to use. Only complaint is it seems to have trouble syncing when I first open it. Always says &quot;sync failed.&quot; But when I tap the refresh button manually, it refreshes and works fine.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app has been invaluable for taking notes at meetings, linking them to audio recordings, and organizing my notes and sharing them between devices
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app for making quick notes and having them sync to acess across many devices.  I use it for work constantly and for grocery lists.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Never worked for me. Would not let me sign in or do anything. not sure what it is for or supposed to be used for.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It is a simple note-taking program that is easy to sync between all your devices. I use it for school, work, and everything in between.'Can't really go wrong if you need universal access to your notes on your devices.
1	B004LOMB2Q	This was the best notepad available (at the time) for my Kindle Fire, then they changed it.  Now it requires you to log in using a WiFi connection, which is fine if you have an available signal 24-7.  If you don't, which is usually the case when you're out and about, then you can't access any of your notes.  You can't even try to make a note if there is no WiFi signal.  Even if you have a signal you have to log in before you can do anything and if you forget your password and try to retrieve it through the app it won't allow you to.Overall it's great if you have a 24-7 WiFi connection, if you don't then pass this up.  I gave up and deleted the app after several attempts on my home pc to try and set up a password and it failed.
3	B004LOMB2Q	after trying several notebooks before I tried evernote and so far it is living upto it's reputation of being a great digital notebook ever
3	B004LOMB2Q	if your looking for something to use as a diary or as a digital sticky note or at least to remember something, then you better tap that &quot;get app&quot;button
3	B004LOMB2Q	In the limited amount of time I've been using it, it seems to be a very capable app, however I wasn't able to give five stars because it isn't very user intuitive.  I find it rather difficult to decipher by way of the icons, just eh gay it will or can do.  The sync function however is is very good and has flawlessly synced my info across a kindle fire HD, a Motorola photon and my laptop.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app has been very helpful. It allows you to set up several notebooks or folders with daily information. You can anything from a simple to do list, great picture reminders of special events, a journal, ideas saved off of the Internet, anything. All in one simple to use app. You can also use this app on other devices, and can still access the very same notebooks.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great ap for organization of any sorts. It has a lot of capabilities as well as has a www you can visit for a different view and more capabilities. Try it out it's free. And above all works great on my kindle fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	So worth your time to download this! I write notes; to do, groceries, etc.,at home on my kindle and it shares it with my android phone(have to download app to phone,too) so that I always have my notes with me. Love this!
3	B004LOMB2Q	i love this app! i have it on my phone, tablet &amp; ipod touch!  i can look at, edit or add new notes from any devices and loo at it from another. with 4 note books to add and use! i could not live with out it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Very helpful to save quick notes or full documents and to be able to see from my kindle, phone and  computer
3	B004LOMB2Q	Whatever you want in an online shareholder application, this one has it. Easy to use, easy to edit files, and flawless synchronization with desktop, tablet, phone and laptop. Lots of free storage and beautifully designed headers on your hard copy printouts. And it's free.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Presently I use one notebook for my genealogy findings, one for recipes - if it had been around before I retired would have found constant usage - clip notes (or write notes), tag them, free word association search - excellent!  Have it synced to my phone, computers, tablets - up to date on any device you choose!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Ive been using evernote for a few months now and I think its awesome! I use it to help me remember thing both past and present.. little notes throughout the day.. I also copy and paste links from articles I like or would like to view later... if you have a mic you can do voice recorded notes and there are just so many options! My fab thing about it is when my kindle was destroyed and had to be replaced all my notes where still right here... hence the Ever in evernote... GET IT!
1	B004LOMB2Q	Too hard to figure out.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I wish there was a shortcut / hot key on my kindle fire which allowed me to access this app directly.  Great user interface.  Meshes with a nice drawing app called skitch.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Originally I wasn't a big Evernote fan, I found other programs to work with instead. Now however I love Evernote. It's the best program I have found to sync between my laptop and my original Kindle Fire. I don't have to email things back and forth between my devices and can make changes on either device :)Great functionality! Thanks Evernote!
2	B004LOMB2Q	not sure what they'll do with my contacts, good luck with that. might be more here than I'm not using yet.
3	B004LOMB2Q	And easy to use.  I especially enjoy being able to copy and paste and then add photos to the articles, not just attachments.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Extremely useful, cross platform app. I especially like the ability to create individual notebooks for different projects. I recommend this to anyone used to using an app to stay organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Good enough synching which is why I needed it in the first place. Could be more dynamic but it's okay so far.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A way to organize the dozens of lists I continually need to add to or edit.  I've  barely scratched the surface of ways to use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've been looking for something like this since Microsoft stopped adding Cardfile to Windows. This is the place for all of that sticky note information you don't want to lose track of. I love that I can get to it on my phone, Kindle Fire, or any computer I use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A good program.  Good way to take notes over different unitsone two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen to fulfill required number of words.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Not bad.  I don't know if it can deliver all of the features that its PC counterpart does.  I'll explore more.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am still finding a good use for Evernote but it is simple to use. As I use it I hope to learn more about it. I am still using one note as evernote does not work with office 2013.
1	B004LOMB2Q	this is probably great product for some people but I use a calendar already for reminder and email for notes or Work
3	B004LOMB2Q	Excellent app for keeping notes.  Pure &amp; simple, the best app for keeping notes.  Automatically syncs with all your devices when you sign in.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is a very handy app to have. I use it in so many different areas of my life: Recording homework assignments; taking snapshots on the board with my phone to review and make notes on the Kindle Fire later (using Skitch) and exercise routines so I can quickly glance at them in the gym.The mobile UI is fine, though I wouldn't object to an upgrade to make it easier to use.It's never let me down in terms of functuality, and I would definitely recommend it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	So quit worrying about Mac or PC - software developers are now realizing how to make everything work together and even if you head isn't in the &#34;clouds&#34; - this app is sweet.  Download it, use it, and refer it.  Its super cool.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I liked Evernote so much, I became a premium customer very early on. I use it for cataloging radio show ideas, keeping track of favorite websites, and for cutting and pasting information that I'm sure will be useful later.The interface is easy-to-understand, and the developers are constantly looking for ways to improve it. I'm certain I'll be a paying customer for years to come. Try Evernote. You'll love it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this program because I can sync my Kindle Fire w/my computer or vice oversaw. That way I know I'll never lose an important note that I had to write while away from home especially since I need notes for reminders. So I can make a note on the computer and know it'll be on my Kindle when I need it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It is simply the best software I have used in keeping tract of information (internet, audio, video, pics &amp; notes).
3	B004LOMB2Q	The uses of this app are limited only by your imagination. Someone hands me a biz card?...  I use vernote to take a picture of it and save it...  notes on a screen..same...  notes on a napkin?..same. Address or phone number in your memory and afraid of forgetting it? same using the voice recorder function. Also use the PC version... best of all?.It Was FREE!!!
2	B004LOMB2Q	I think I like the product and would probably REALLY like it, if I was running Windows or MacOS on my Laptop.  Works well on my Android phone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A definite utility for anyone's toolbox of productivity. It's a very important bookmarks holder that goes across all platforms. This is the real cat's pajamas.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I dont usually like giving 5 Star reviews but I can honestly say I could not find anything to ding it on.  syncing to the web workks great.  Runs fine on my DroidX.  Does everything as advertised.  All in all a well designed app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I was introduced to Evernote by a friend. Tried it and discovered its potential and usefulness. A great productivity tool. If you haven't installed it on all of your computer platforms, you need to!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've got evernote installed on every device i own and it's been a life saver!Having my notes and whatever else i want always available no matter what device im on is great!
3	B004LOMB2Q	used on kindle fire but great because of syncing capabilities to other devices. great for organization and keeping notes on the go.
3	B004LOMB2Q	very nice its a must for everithing because you can use it almost af any isue hou need. As much as it is related on cloud netwirking.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app so much people should try it out is so helpful thank you very much for whoever I created this app play
3	B004LOMB2Q	Content is tremendous. For free you cannot go wrong. I use this to log in notes for my blog on the go and I couldn't be happier with the ease of use. Only problem I encountered is if you log out, you cannot access your notes offline. Bummer since I'm on the Fire but overall great experience.Update: you can access notes offline by setting it up before logging off.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This App has Officially Saved My Ass! I am able to save my notes from lecture to all of my systems so there is no chance of forgetting them, I have access at all times! Glad This App Was Suggested
3	B004LOMB2Q	very helpful app!! everyday I can list and notes all the things I needed to do. highly recommended .. very awesome app!.. you all will surely love this app guys! it's free!! whoo! thanks for the people who made this app! .. enjoy guys.. evermore is a nice one!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I put everything into this app - grocery lists, gardening maps, all those damn passwords.  My only complaint is that the little icons are not very self explanatory until one gets the hang of it.
2	B004LOMB2Q	Actually, this app is excellent and it has been very useful for me since I have installed it from the first time. I have my notes, thoughts, ideas, images, my job's info, etc. recorded and organized easily and instantly. But recently, I have had many difficulties synchronizing my info and accessing it offline. It is a pain to try to recover info on the Android version; it takes too long to load. Also, after one the the major updates, the app couldn't access the URL to synch notes, notebooks and other stuff; it did not recognize or accept my password. I had to log out, restart the device, restart the app, and login, only to find out that all the info wasn't there any more. Then, I had to wait some time for the app to retrieve everything again via Wi-Fi from Evernote server. Now, I am scared when I find new update requests, which  are very often now, because I don't want to go through again for a new process for changing passwords, restarting, synchronizing the WHOLE stuff again, authenticating users, wondering why the app does not work any more, or finding solutions on the Internet. In short, fearing that new updates will mess everything up.
3	B004LOMB2Q	FELL IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT SO MUCH THAT ALL OF MY ELECTRONIC DEVICES AT HOME AND AT WORK HAVE IT DOWNLOADED! GREAT MEMORY EXPANDING TOOL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
1	B004LOMB2Q	When I first got Evermore, I liked it. I used it a lot. About 3 months after I got this app, I had totally FILLED it. I even had some important notes that took forever to write. The next time I got on Evermore, all my notes were GONE. I would give this app 0 stars, but 1 is the least.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Definitely my favorite notepad app available on the Fire. I can make checklists, tag my notes, attatch pictures to notes, and even search notes! This is a really great app for keeping organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I think evernote is the best note taking app of all time. Problem is that my Zeki tablet isn't compatible so I have to use something else so that all my products are synced. If your devices are all compatible then use this.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I wanted to try this based on the goodreviews, but the permissions are ridiculous! Why would any sane person actually use this app? Not happening...
1	B004LOMB2Q	Okay, I needed a free, basic note tool for my Kindle Fire that would save on my Kindle for offline use, and sync when it is online so I have a back-up and can use the app on my work and home Windows machines.  Evernote has great reviews, so I thought I woud give it a try.I think the biggest problem I had was user experience on my Kindle.  I found the interface a bit confusing, and everytime I tried to add a notebook, it would look like it was saving the new notebook, but would not show up on my list of notebooks.  I could be wrong, but it looks like there is a limit of three notebooks for non-paid subscriptions (or for offline use maybe).The buttons didn't seem very intuitive to me either (placement or look/feel).Anyway, I wasn't using it because it was taking me too long to figure out, so I went looking for another app.  I found SpringPad, which seems a little less popular than Evernote, but for me, it is exactly what I have been looking for and more.So if you are looking for an alternative to EverNote, try SpringPad.  Its free, and it is great for organizing personal notes!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a brilliant app for those using multiple devices. The ease of use, options, and the ability to upload messages instantly to all devices makes this a must have.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Wonderful product especially for free. The amount of things you can accomplish with the app is astounding. And the full membership is relatively cheap for the amount of things it will let you do after you join.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like that you are able to create different notebooks. I am also impressed with how it syncs between devices. I love using the web clipper on my computer and then seeing those notes on my kindle.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Could not get the hang of it. I'm glad some people love it but not me. This is why I wish that there were trial periods for some apps. Happy there are reviews to go by.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote daily to save articles I find while using my PC for reading later on the Kindle Fire. It's become my favorite app for clipping articles and storing notes and reminders. It works seemlessly across mobile and desktop devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	good app I would get it if I were you. Best notebook app ever! Seriously you should get this app
3	B004LOMB2Q	When I got Evernote, I already had a notebook application on my kindle but I quickly grew to prefer evernote. I love the fact that I can view my documents across devices and I like how easily I can insert pictures and share the documents with people.P.s. A nice app that goes along with evernote is Skitch, which is another app by the same company.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Friggin awesome, organize it like 1000 ways and search stuff an  take pictures and bullet points just go buy it you jackass
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a GREAT app, I can't even fully put into words how amazing it is. It is easy to create notes (big or small) and edit them and organize them. You can have different folders so for example if you want to take notes in a class you can put them in that folder, and then your to-do notes can go somewhere else. There is something you can use on your web browser that clips the pages and it will be sent to your evernote account on your kindle. They also have a companion computer application so you can write notes on your computer and they are all synced. Definitely recommend this. Never had a problem with force closing.
3	B004LOMB2Q	No more need to carry a notepad around with you - this ap replaces the pen and paper.  And what makes it better is that you can have the same note synced on all of your devices - so you can write your shopping list on your computer, and look it up on your iPhone or tablet.  Brilliant in its simplicity.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app makes it so convenient to store my info and to have it available over multiple devices. It works great for me.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote has been extremely useful. With it I can take my writing everywhere. I can keep notes on an idea that pops up when I'm away from the house. I can make grocery lists and record recipes. It's a great app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	i needed a way to get my documents from my computer to my kindle fire in a editable format and this works perfectly! sooo sooo happy with this app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I absolutely LOVE this app!! It helps me be and get organized. I really recommend it. Trust me, you won't regret it!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Having Evernote on cell, PC, laptop and tablet means my notes are always available. I can't even imagine getting thru a normal (busy) day without it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I don't know what I did before Evernote (well I do but don't know how I did it). I love evernote and I love that I can access all my evernote content on the go and create new notes on the go. Sometimes I use the app to create quick notes or blogs and then I edit on my desktop to make it more polished but with swype its as good as paper and pen.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is a must have app for those of us who love being organized. I love having the ability to customize all of my content just the way I want. The possibilities. are endless.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is a great app to keep track of information across devices. I use it on two tablets and two PCs. Not only is it very useful for personal notes, but we use it to share notes at work, as well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Starting to like the Evernote program's &#34;syncability&#34; between my computer, kindle and phone. Keeps my thoughts organized and my notes easy to recover.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I never really gave this app a chance until I got the kindle fire, this app is incredible with what you can do with it, this is a must have app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love the cross platform functionality; Kindle Fire, phone, computer, etc. Fast to sync is nice too. Also, adding files and pica and being able to share them...
3	B004LOMB2Q	Helps me if lots of thing at work. Codes, faults, etc. It's a live saving for not haveing to lug books into my job. Elevator tech.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've been using Evernote on the PC almost since it first came out.  It is a great searchable flat database.  I put all kinds of knowledge in here and I'm usually able to pull it right back out.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app. It sinks well with my macbook and adds productive functionality when I'm out and about without wifi. I only wish they'd send the updates through the Amazon Appstore.I'm using the Kindle Fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just love being able to enter lists, notes, and other information once and then to be able to access it on my laptop or Kindle Fire!  It is so much quicker to type on the laptop.  Information can be organized into different notebooks too.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I LOVE this App. The camera has yet to fail me, and being able to take my Kindle and use Evernote ANYWHERE, even WITHOUT WiFi access, makes me love it more. The 'only' discord is that the ONLY way to share is to email. I have to beusing an APP &amp; open Evernote pictures to share on social network sites. KIKI B.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a convenient and easy app that I can sync my kindle fire with laptop and phone. It does not have irritating banners in places you tap accidentally which I really appreciate on a free app. I tried a few other apps to use and this one is my fav so far. It is good for quick reminders and grocery list so many app features are in one place, so u don't need so many apps installed and stores nicely on sd card. I highly recommend this app.Thanks to whomever it was that created evernote app. I appreciate it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is so helpful! Keeps all pertinent info in one easy to find place,  from my computer, my phone, my Kindle Fire....
1	B004LOMB2Q	I cancelled this app about 10 minutes later, not sure if I didn't give it enough time to understand it or not.  Did not like at all, I use the cozi family app and it seems to work much better for what I need
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this all the time for work and at home. I would be lost without it, since it syncs everything I use it on. This is one of the first apps I put on all my devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I haven't downloaded this app. but can somebody tell me if you can copy and paste? I would really like to know
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like that it's easy to use and to share if I want to, and I can get to it from my computer or from my phone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this every day. I especially like the way it syncs with my laptop. I highly recommend this product to anyone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	My husband introduced this note taking program to me. . I'm not real good at keeping up with myself now we can have joint lists and  private notes
3	B004LOMB2Q	syncs with my Kindle Fire and with my Asus tablet so i have access to handwritten and typed notes wherever i go.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app.  Use it on my phone, computer, kindle fire.  My wife and both use it to share to do lists.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is excellent and has saved me many times! I love that it's not saved to the device but thru email so I can access it on anything!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is the easiest way to keep up with the random information in your life. I need to know my air filter size I enter it on the comp and it follows me to the store. If I could master shareable lists shopping lists and wish lists would be a snap to share and easy to update!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is Great and that's all that can describe it.Its obvious that this is all a good product. Awesome and I love it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i really like this app! with this app it is easy to jot down a quick reminder or note.  you can also create lists! rhis os a great app for notes, lists, and even diary entries!! have fun withthis cool app!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Very handy and versatile, but tutorials could be better.  I'm going to need a book to learn it.  Two more words.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a versatile app, and works well for my need.  I need to take short notes for business.  I like the organizational abilities to arrange your notes by subject.  BUT, why cant they come up with a useful to to module?  There are ways to jury rig a to do list, but it seems a glaring omission.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It turns out this is it! I could download my file onto my kindle fire and edit the crap out of it as if it were a note to self. I created an eleven page AP level newspaper on WWII on my tablet for free. I couldn't have asked for more, but there's more in the app anyways.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is extremely useful and it's features can be helpful in countless ways. I would give it a ten if I could.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This was recommended by a few coworkers but I delayed getting it til my network drive crashed.This has helped with that loss as I can keep notes and even excel files it it and access from 4 different devices (the network drive was only accessible from 2).It's easy to use and useful.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i have enjoyed the easeof this product and having the elephant as the image doesn't hurt either.  I love how simple it is to use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this application almost daily. It lets me clip and store web pages that I use for research. I've also started using it as a Journal. The handiest part is that it's available on multiple platforms, so the same notes and clippings are within reach on my PC, Kindle or phone. Our, if I'm stranded with nothing but a computer with net access (say at a friend's or the library) I can log in to the Evernote website and find my stuff. The website also has idea starters for various professions.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evermore has had a great start. The more I learn, the more I like it and use it. Eventually I would like to see it handle almost t s of multimedia.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I just use it as a notepad to make shopping lists, party supply lists. Nothing fancy, which is what I like most about it. It's user friendly.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Excellent APP. No joke! This app works along with others and makesthis app very special.I like it and use it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Awesome app. I use it all the time. I found it's brutally easy to move between all three of my kindles with this app, and works beautifully with my kindle HD. And the added ability to take pictures with the camera just rocks...
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have access to this on my phone and online. I keep notes on it that I want to be able to read later. My husband and I used this to prepare for our wedding. We could share our notes with one another. The only drawback is that you have to get the premium edition to be able to share AND edit notes. Still, it's a great app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app.  You will love it store all your notes in indexed method.  organize everything.  great for pictures.  first app I install
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm using evernote to organize my journal entries for my thesis. being able to tag and format each entry reply helps when I go back to review them. syncing between my Fire and laptop is a great plus too!
2	B004LOMB2Q	Pros: it goes where I go.Cons: adding meaningful notes is tedious on anything but the computer.I mostly just use this for reading recipes on my phone or Kindle Fire while in the kitchen.  I avoid adding notes with this app whenever possible.  It is just way too much easier on the computer with the Chrome extension.It does what it should, but I'm just really picky about notes in general and quickly/easily I can edit and fine tune them.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I really like this app.  I can organize my thoughts and notes very easely, and sync them with my other devices later!
1	B004LOMB2Q	If you expect to write a quick note on your Kindle Fire and view it later, you may be surprised when you can't view it unless you're online. I was. If you try to view your note while offline all you get is a screen suggesting an upgrade to the full version. Evernote allows you to synch your notes across many devices, which is good if that's what you're looking for. If you just want to keep some reminders on your Kindle then it's quite disappointing. Fortunately there are other apps that are very happy to record your notes and let you view them, all right there on the Kindle. No need to turn on wireless just to view a note.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app was much needed for my daily activities.  I was disappointed that I didn't h.  ave a w.ay to take notes for my tablet.  Thanks to evernote I have the electronic complete planner in the palm of my hands
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am just now getting into Evermore, but I like what I see so far.  Easy to use and it does help keep me organized. I can't wait to unlock all the possibilities.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I tried other similar apps but not satisfied. I tried Evernote and I LOVE it. Very easy to use. Very easy to sync to all my devices. And all the extra features are a plus. You can't beat the price. TY Evernote!
1	B004LOMB2Q	To make it short and sweet... Perhaps this is a great application (though it looks & feels like a lot of eye-candy for functions already on my Kindle Fire HD).I won't really know 'cause I'm not running any app with permissions to use my personal info so freely. Apparently thousands of users find it acceptable. I don't. Uninstalled.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i make list, write speeches...this app is amazing. the only thing my kindle doesn't have a rear facing camera so i cant take photos of my bills or business cards, i have evernote on my laptop too and it syncs all my notes and list.i actually use it to make my grocery list as i run out of stuff and then just grab my tablet and to the grocery store.
3	B004LOMB2Q	works well ... love the PC / phone / tablet snyc. Glad I discovered this little gem and I will be recommending this little app to family and friends.Bought this in August, now it is December and this app has turned into the great utility of 2012 ... and now on with the addition to the review:I've owned Evernote for a while, now -- Great product! NOT a 'little' app, but one that is full-featured and wonderful not only in concept, but in the execution of that concept. I even coughed up the money to go Premium. And installed 'Clearly,' ( [...]) their screen-scraping utility that removes all the ads and other superfluous stuff so all you clip is the meat of the article. GREAT utility. Notes from any of my devices. Saves my recipes, my hobbies, my website design tutorials and ANYTHING I want to refer to later. It is heuristic, remembers how I tagged my previous clippings of similar content and not only places them in the correct notebook, but tags them correctly.I'm not sure I could live without it and certainly wouldn't want to. GREAT JOB, Evernote.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I have used Evernote on a Mac and a Windows PC, and even an iPod Touch, all with no problem. It doesn't appear to work on my Kindle Fire HD 8,9. I click on folders but the contents never appear. Either I'm doing something wrong, or it's the Kindle that is interfering with the app running properly.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i use this for distance learning on my KF. love everything. have it at work and on laptop as well as my windows smart phone. beats the heck out of windows onenote, especially since the free version is so incredibly functional!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Versatile and user friendly. This app does more stuff than I ever expected. Every time I use EverNote I discover something new.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have MS OneNote and I like Evernote better.  This app is so easy to use and so well supported it is just the thing to wean one off paper notes you can never find when you need them!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like it. works great and can check out my docs, pics,  or drafts anywhere with my pc,  kindle or phone. using it with my team to stay on track for organizing and planning events.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I when I first got Evernote I fell in love! I think its just a great way to organize your thoughts and helps with all your special prioritys!!! I absulutely love it!!!
2	B004LOMB2Q	started out having issues on how and what the app does but it's getting easier each timeso don't feel dumb if u don't get it right from the start
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app!  I use it every day.  I was always losing my paper lists, which is seriously frustrating! With Evernote, I am able to make a list on my PC or Kindle Fire and have it available wherever I am.  I adore the check list feature, which I use daily.  Evernote is helping me to become more organized!  I would highly recommend this app for everyone!
3	B004LOMB2Q	How can you not love Evernote!  It's one of the best apps out there for storing, organizing, and keeping you on track.  Great supplement to the iPad but good to also see in your Kindle as well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this on ALL my devices - phones, tablets, desktop, laptops, netbooks (Win7, Android and Apple iOS7). I found it when I started doing research work and then discovered I usually had the info on the &#34;wrong&#34; device later (the one I didn't have with me!) This has been a lifesaver and is one tremendous program with more power than anticipated. You may also want to check out &#34;Penultimate&#34; by the same folks.It syncs seamlessly and without one even noticing... it allows you to add at least some &#34;formatting&#34; and such, too. What more could you want for FREE?????
2	B004LOMB2Q	This app works great. It keeps track of everything and I love the little elephant on the app itself. Cute.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Thank goodness for everyone and stitch.  Stitch does a good job with handwriting too.  You have to write slowly, though.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am still trying to figure out this app but so far I like it. I'm using this first and for most for keeping records of my son's homeschool work. I might even branch off and use it for every day use also.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote for a lot of things. Taking notes, keeping track of recipes and receipts, journaling, information about places, ideas for where I want to go, writing. I am far better with electronic notes than I am with paper ones. I have it on my computers, phone, tablets and I sync between all of them with the Premium version. The Premium version also allows me to save a notebook to a particular device. I use it at least once a day and find it to be very useful.I do wish for a few things:* I'd like the privacy policy to be more robust* I'd like to be able to encrypt an entire folder, not just a document.* I'd like to be able to encrypt a document from a tablet, not just a computer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use evermore all the time. It started with school and now I use it for everything. I record teachers lectures, keep a diary, draw, an and even keep a work log. Thanks evermore!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I always liked evernote I can do my homework where ever and print it out from the website I save notes from school and able to save them I specific folders for later review and print I highly recommend this app for students especially students on the Go!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app that is used all the time.  Premium features are worth the yearly fee.  I do agree with others that permissions are excessive.  Being offered a choice of what permissions to approve individually would be nice,  understanding that denying a permission might disable a feature
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is on everything!! My Ipad, Kindle, & cell phone. Great way to keep track of recipes. Highly recommend!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Fantastic way to get just about anything from my PC to & from my Kindle. Including. docs, diagrams, pictures and any combination of these above.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It provides the help to save some notes for later.  I will continue to have it as a nice feature for my Kindle.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I loved this app because it kept my notes updated everywhere... my kindle fire, Pc, and my cellphone. but recently it kept deleting all my notes! I had to continuosly recreate all I could remember until I just gave up and uninstalled it, happened about 5 times.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A must have app on any device. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD, iPhone and Desktop PC. I use it all the time to synchronize my notes and keep my important information updated.
3	B004LOMB2Q	a great way to jot down notes or to keep up a series of notes.. to be able to customize and all!! I love it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app has helped me tremendously while traveling. I can make lots of REMINDER notes which is a mustwhen I am traveling. I even used it to copy and save documents. I love it, it's a great tool to have.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I really like Evernote.  I have it on all my devices.  It is unusual to have an app that will work so well on my PC, Mac and Kindle.  This app keeps my information available wherever I am.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Fabulous app and tool.  Not only can I take notes and document meetings, ideas, concepts and thoughts but I can easily share them with colleagues and family members.  I used another app for a while but Evernote is by far a superior tool
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is intuitive and easy to use.  Only reason it doesn't get five stars is due to that recent &#34;issue&#34; in the news.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I needed places to put things plus the ability to find what I was looking for when I needed it - not two days later. Evernote meets my needs and expectations to the moon and back. Recipes, patterns with photos, notes, ideas, lots of thoughts and ideas. All divided up into neat little notebooks that can be stacked together according to whatever criteria I choose. My ideas, my choices, my Evernote. Who could ask for more?
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app. It makes reminders, notebooks, and organization so easy!!!!!  It is so awesome. I think everybody should have this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is one of the note apps that's been around for a while and is very popular. As a result, it's been well tested, debugged, and refined over the years and you can expect a smooth, bug-free, and capable app when you buy it. Evernote has exceptional file and information handling capabilities and allows you to capture, store and share not just notes but photos, webpages, freehand drawings and graphics, and pretty much anything you want. The premium edition allows your friends to access and modify your notes and so offers group collaboration capabilities.Another area Evernote excels in is the sheer number and diversity of its companion apps. Just a quick look at what was available at the Apple store revealed no less than 20 and there were more that I didn't bother to scroll through when I stopped. These included:Evercrane--a file and note management app providing quick sorting and moving featuresMoveover--another file and note management appClever--a powerful interface and client app with many useful functions (too many to list here)Evernote Food--a recipe programEvernote Hello--a powerful contacts managervJournal for Evernote--a daily journal programFastEver--quickly add notes, tags, and organize notes into notebooksEverclip--a webpage clipperFastEver Snap--a camera for EvernoteEverConvertor--a currency converter for EvernoteCheckEver--a way to manage your checklistsQEver--add reminders to your notesENPower--quick access to your Evernote notes, notebooks, and  tagsMultiSnap--quickly snap and send photosMoveEver--another powerful sort and organizer app similar to MoveOver and EvercraneTap2Ever--fast Evernote uploaderEverGear--note and photo posting appEverWord--EverNote flashcards app with database-like capabilitiesEverEPub--make an EPub book from your notesEverLog--a logging and posting app for EverNoteThat's just some of the companion apps that I saw. There are more and there is often more than one app available in a particular category (note management, daily journal, etc.) so that if you don't like that particular companion app there may be another you will like.In reading the reviews here I note that some people didn't like Evernote wanting access to all of their contacts, which they considered an invasion of privacy. So if this is a probem for you you should consider that before buying the app.Overall Evernote offers a lot of value for the money and has the most add-ons and companion apps of any app in the note category. There is something for just about everyone so if you're looking for a good note and task app Evernote is one of the top offerings that you should consider.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app. I use it for every research project. I would have to expected this to be an paid app. It's very polished and has pleanty of features.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm only in 6th grade but it is so useful to me I love the tags that has to be my favorite feature.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like that it is cloud notes. I have quick access to notes that I took, and the cloud helps
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evermore lets you share notes photos and more among all your computes. I like it for import notes and general ones as well. Make multiple notebooks to organize notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This has been the best note taker, keeper, organizer I've used yet. I tend to be very organized and this helped a lot. It is simple to use, and list out what you've added.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love having this so no matter what I am on and find if I want to have it with me and I have it boom that is it awesome
3	B004LOMB2Q	It syncs with my Pc, iphone and my kindle fire. Great app with awesome features. Would pay for this but it's freeeeee!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use it to organize my recipes, menus and shopping lists in one notebook. In another I keep patterns and photos of creative projects. I can see that this app will quickly become indespensible as I find additional uses.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote extensively. I can clip things from the web, add to my Evernote, and sync with my kindle so that I keep recipes and notes I've taken at hand when I'm away from my computer. It's great for adding and sharing information with my email friends too.
3	B004LOMB2Q	love this program to be able to save memory's is priceless and music clips along with pictures then be able to share it... luv it
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am using Evernote for notes that I can access on Windows, Mac, webOS and Kindle Fire. If your platform is not yet supported web client is good enough substitute.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I finally got around to trying Evernote and I'm glad I did. It convenient and super easy to use. The only reason it doesn't get a 5 from me is the need to purchase additional storage space. There's only so much you can save in a month, but there's no indication when my month started or ends. The additional cost is not much but there is an additional charge for more space. So I have to buy more space.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this on kindle fire and it works very well. This is the best note taking software that I have been able to find.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app let's you use the same format from phone to tablet to pc making it much easier to shoot notes off quickly. Also solves the no camera problem with kindle fire; take photo with phone, automatically updated to kindle.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I have once again (by accident) accepted the update for Evernote on my Kindle Fire and it stopped working. I can only use it if I decline ALL updates. Great App no doubt about it, but developers or Amazon please debug it. Uninstall and re-install fixes it and all my notes are back, but if I bump the update with a fat finger I start over.
3	B004LOMB2Q	easy to use, the sync is great. i haven't handwritten a note since i installed this ap. highly recommended. love the tags and sorting options.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have used Evernote extensively and I have used Springpad extensively. I have read many reviews on both. Here is my conclusion. It is a matter of personal preference. I will say that more creative personalities will prefer Springpad. More business people will prefer Evernote.I will say this...For Kindle Fire Users...Evernote has proven to be more stable on the Kindle Fire.Since springpad is free, I will continue to use it for very specific applications, but Evernote is my primary app.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Downloaded this app and it set off a threat warning in my security app. I immediately uninstalled it. Leaves too much open for unauthorized access.
3	B004LOMB2Q	THIS IS SOMETHING ESSENTIAL FOR WEB REASEARCH AND INFORMATION GATHERING. IT WORKS PERFECT ON MY KINDLE FIRE V1, OPTIMUS V DROID 2.2 PHONE, AND IN CHROME ON WINDOWS 7.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I don't know how I could love Evernote any more than I do.  I mean, I've always been a Mac User.  Last Christmas, my husband bought me a Kindle Fire HD, and my first concern was if I could download an Evernote app for it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	fast, easy, and able to reach your notes anywhere.  I like simple.  Evernote is just that.  No fancy stuff just what a writer needs.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have Evernote on my computer and use the web clipper everyday to save articles and information for later.  Now I have it on my Kindle and much to my surprise - everything works together!  Can't say that too often.  I also recently got Everfood and it pulled all the recipes I'd been saving in Evernote into the other program - seemlessly.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This has streamlined how I collect online info. And it's automatically accessible on both my kindle and the computer. Can't recommend it highly enough.
3	B004LOMB2Q	The developer is devoted to improving the product and making it easier to interface with browsers. What's more, its cloud interface allows seamless synch. with all your computers.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'm a OneNote user and I have been trying to find the Linux / Android alternative and none of them really stack up to OneNote. Still trying and will continue to tinker with evernote.
1	B004LOMB2Q	This app has helped me a lot in the past but it still wasn't complete. I recommend getting Colornote instead but thats just my opinion;)
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote, man, what can I say, this app is great, in always on the go, at work in usual on the move and don't have my laptop with me, but I always have my kindle with me. Evernote keeps all of my notes and projects in 1 easy to use app. If you're a member of the mobile life style, you need this!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	It's not quite as efficient as taking notes on a laptop or even taking notes on paper, but it does work well and does allow you to have all of your notes in one unified place.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I.Love.This.App.Evernote is just one awesome invention, and I'm glad i can use it on my kindle too!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am able to write everything I want, save them, use whenever I want, etc. The best thing is that I downloaded it from my Blackberry. I can sync anything both side.You can type using most of the formats in Word. Great app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I deal with my tablet, laptop, desktop and phone. I no longer need to transfer the information or print it out.  I have found Evernote helpful in keeping my notes, projects and information available when I need it and that is just the free version.
3	B004LOMB2Q	The best feature of the sharing is the auto sync so the info is always up to date on all devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app works great and the sync is great. Add notes on my tablet and then there they are on my phone. No crashes and reliable sync.
1	B004LOMB2Q	A friend had me download this for a trip I was taking and I don't get it at all. Seems way too complicated.
3	B004LOMB2Q	i use evernote on desktop and was delighted to find the app works perfectly for me on kindle fire. once i realized that i was able to stop looking at other note, organizer, to do list apps.  evernote does everything i need and with this app, i can take it everywhere.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am able to quickly create notes, from grocery lists to doctors appointments and medicine lists to meeting minutes for different projects and share them immediately with my family or co-workers
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app world great. the only thing it is missing is a corresponding app to sync with my phone. evernote doesn't make an app that's compatible with it.
1	B004LOMB2Q	With the shut down of Springpad, we have been given this option ... Well it just isn't Springpad. Very sad.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I teach sixth grade English, and I use Evernote to outline lesson plans, generate notes for lessons, keep discipline records, record parent contacts, keep and generate writing prompts.  I also use it to keep notes for PLC meetings.As a writer, I use Evernote to draft blogs and keep blog ideas.  I use it to outline novel ideas and nonfiction book ideas.  I generate plot maps and character sketches.As a mom, I keep my daily calendar and grocery list.I keep my daily pages and reflection journals on it.It is easy to use.  I can send websites and articles to it for research.  I use it to save my digital art.Evernote is an important tool for me.  I have the premium version and it is well worth it.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Don't download this product without reading about it first!!!  Has it's nose in everything you do! I learned by mistake but wound up removing it from my device. I will be more careful in the future about things such as this!
2	B004LOMB2Q	Several times it has told me to click for an update but when I click it, it never runs the updates.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I bought this app for my Kindle Fire--it works very well, is easy to use and I am happy with its features.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have evernote on my phone, computers, kindles. It replaces what sticky notes used to be for me. It is a must have app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote for class, work, grocery lists, personal notes, reminders, and more. It integrates well and syncs between multiple computers, tablets, and phones. I've tried a few other apps but none compare to the simplicity of this and the convenience. Highly recommended if you're looking for a simple note taking app or one that is more complex. The ability to have type, hand drawn/written, or audio notes all within a single note has been a huge help in organizing important notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Looks and runs great on my Kindle Fire and my HTC Desire CM7.I was using Springpad for a long time, but I feel this is a much cleaner ui. Chrome extentions like Clearly really help clip pages how I would like to read an article.
3	B004LOMB2Q	absolute joy. My life is organised.  love the email feature too. I would recommend this app to anyone. Get IT!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is a great app, because it allows you to leave your paper, pen or pencil behind when you are researching some something on the Internet.  Just highlight the portion of the article that you want to save.  Then click Evernote & that passage is saved in Evernote.  You can add a tag to it so that you can better identify it when you come back it.  I also use it to save receipts from Internet purchases when I am using a device that is not connected to a printer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is so useful. it works great on the kindle fire and has never froze while I was using it. I recommend this app for anyone who uses a lot of note pads or sticky notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is one of the best tools to use to support productivity and track ideas that develop when not near a Pc. I also like the fact that I can get to it on my tablet and Pc. Its helpful and usable. Great tool.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app with lots of features even in this free version.  Easy to use and syncs to google as well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Pros:I just like it.  It's more straightforward than Springpad.Cons:Barcode scanning. In Springpad I can scan a barcode, and it will get info from the web and save it in text format.With Evernote there is no such feature. I can exit Evernote, use a barcode scanning app, find the barcode info in the Life V2 Browser, and import a picture (an image file, not text) of the web page or part of that page.  It's a big data hog AND it's not text which means it's a pita to work with.  Not only that, but if I want to use Evernote's text recognition software I have to send a data-hoggong image over the network.  Data plans cost too much, thanks but no thanks.Related note: I do like the Life V2 Browser.  I only tried it because of its Evernote capabilities, but I am pleased with the browser overall.
3	B004LOMB2Q	The interface with the internet is priceless, allowing updates from multiple devices or your PC to become available everywhere, all the time, on demand.  The synching algorithm seems robust and works in the background.  I like the ability to jot down notes on anything when they occur to me, then organize them later, or to dump a large document needing to be edited into Evernote then edit it on my tablet or Kindle with all editions showing up everywhere else.  Searchable, sortable, and filterable.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app works as it should on my Kindle Fire. it's fairly seemless with my computer and my Droid Razr.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This allows me versatility to save at home for the office and vice versa! I love the ease and flexibility to work on kindle fire tablet, work PC, my ipod and home net book!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is a must have for everyone.  Its extremely easy to use.  One of the best features is how it syncs with your cell, laptop, tablet (I use a Kindle Fire).  No matter where I go I can take all my notes, shopping lists, reminders, web sites with me for a quick reference without any extra papers, etc.  I'd be lost without Evermore!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app. I can sync my phone tablet and computer. it really helps me keep my business notes from meeting and I keep it as a journal.
1	B004LOMB2Q	It's an ok app.  I don't like using it so I deleted it from my ereader.  It's not what I wanted.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This has completely eliminated all of my lost scraps floating around the house. No more paper. And it goes everywhere with me on my tablet. Syncs automatically so switching my device still keeps my notes.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I was looking for a cross platform note taking app, I have a kindle, iphone, and use the PC. Evernote is perfect for this. It works as it should. If you don't like the permissions, don't download. If you don't download, you don't have merit to review, pretty simple concept. We live in a technologically invasive era. Get over it, it will only get worse.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I can't believe it's free.  REALLY GOOD APP! I absolutely like the easy interface between my phone, kindle fire and computer.  I had things I was having to print out on a weekly basis and now they are on my kindle fire and totally accessible.  I have gone from taking. a portable filing cabinet everywhere I go to just needing my Kindle Fire.  Also finding and downloading for my phone and computer was EASY!  Thanks for this app
1	B004LOMB2Q	I tried to use Evernote for a second time recently, and I really did like some of its features. But the main reason for my using it is to get captures of the web sites I find while reading or browsing on a desktop computer, and then reading them on my Kindle Fire HD later--especially while travelling.Unfortunately, and for reasons I cannot understand, it is NOT possible to use this feature on a Kindle Fire HD. Perhaps it works on other tablets. But for me, this is just a waste of my time.Unless I find some &#34;work around&#34; I will soon be uninstalling Evernote from my desktop computers
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is really convinient for me as a college student because I can look at my notes from any computer or device. I know I'll never lose them because a notebook is damaged or I get a virus. The only drawback is that I can't view things if I'm offline and can't sync it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Using Evernote, means I don't need to write things down on paper anymore! Especially, when talking to a client on the phone. How cool is that!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	How anyone gets by without this program is beyond me.  I would not be able to do all I do, without it.  I would give it 6 stars were it possible!
1	B004LOMB2Q	Too cumberson; too many choices. Have tried it twice and deleted it both times. I just want to write myself a note. I don't need notebooks and categories, etc. I don't care about sharing my notes between devices. I'd like something that works like a small pad of paper. Take a note, accomplish the task noted, then toss the note. Don't need all the high tech "stuff".
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great place to keep shopping lists and jot ideas or reminders.  I have only tried ColorNote which I also liked but it didn't sync to my other devices.  Syncing is a sweet feature between my phone, Kindle, and computer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, liberty 2.01)I'll review evernote itself, and then review the alternatives...Evernote Pros:This is a great app, for a service that has been around for awhile. It works well, and the combination of this with the premium service is, well, powerful. I think it's clear at this point that evernote is a solid piece of software, making a lot of peoples lives easier. The searching capabilities, sharing, and ocr push it to the next level. The UI is simple to use, and it really i seasy to figure everything out.Evernote Cons:It has a pretty large install size for a note taking app, amazons version is way bigger than straight off the android market. And the terms of service, if actually read, would turn a lot of people off. The premium services are nice, but I don't know many who can justify $50 a year on them.SPRINGPAD vs EVERNOTE vs CATCH:That's right, evernote is not the only one at this block-party. It's been around so long, and well marketed, that I think services like springpad and catch are still in the midst of trying to get peoples attention. They all do basic note taking and organization well. I think most people would be satisfied with any of these services. It really might take you trying each, to find the one you like the most. Id like to urge people to try these other services, as I really do like springpad better than evernote. Catch has a pretty plain ui as well, and does work well, but it wasn't for me. If the premium services for evernote weren't $50/year it would be a no-brainer. But the fact of the matter is that they are. And for us, amateurs ;)...Who refuse to drop that kind of dough on something like evernote. The playing field becomes completely level...Springpad's website has been great, easy to use..very customizable, and a lot of options. I was already in love with this service, then out of no where the company released a ground-breaking ui overhaul, especially concerning the springpad mobile app. It's amazing now, looks exactly like what appears on the website. Works extremely well, smooth, auto-syncing..and easy to share to and from it. The widgets in my opinion are better than evernotes, and i enjoy using this application a lot more as well. It has everything i'd ever want, Springpad ftw.
3	B004LOMB2Q	So long post-it notes....Evernote is here to stay!  This app is absolutely great!  I love the convenience of using this.....I just contacted the developer the other day with a few questions that I had, and they got right back to me....which was super.  I would recommend this app to anyone--whether they are taking notes for a High School or College Class, or they are writing reminder items for themselves, keeping track of contributions, or just recording everyday information.I deleted this program in favor of another note program (which now ceases to exist), but before they packed up, I re-installed Evernote.  This program was used to help me teach, and it is installed on both my computer and on my kindle.  Having looked at each program in the Evernote family, I'm now decided that this is the program that I need to have.  I can't believe how often it gets used, too....This is great!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is a great way to allow your devices to &quot;friend&quot;  each other!  Seriously, having a way to organize your stuff for easy retrieval or update with synch from anywhere is awesome for today's device and knowledge junkies.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app lets me have everything no matter where I am and no matter if I'm using my kindle fire or my phone or even any computer.  I love using it for recipes. shopping list and tons of other things.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Taking notes the old fashioned way - with pen and paper - works well until you've misplaced the note or have managed to leave it behind. In today's age, keeping track of your notes with Evernote is as easy as saving them to your electronic device and having the ability to access them from the office, in the home, or on the go!Gone are the days of trying to decipher quick jots. Quickly type and save your notes with Evernote and never rack your brain over handwritten messages again! Want an image to provide a helpful reminder? Evernote's attachment feature allows you to save your note with an image or a photo from your mobile device's camera!Simply put: Evernote has revolutionized the way we remind ourselves and makes note-taking a more efficient way of conducting business, taking care of hosehold chores, and just about anything that could slip our minds. The application is neatly arranged, easily accessible and does offer handwritten functionality for those that prefer to use a stylis to write out their messages.I highly recommend this application to anyone looking to become more organized and especially to those who are constantly on the go and have the need to access their notes from just about anywhere in the world. This application is huge time and grief saver!Lastly, the reason for the deduction of one star is because of the restricted access to features reserved for a premium (paid) version. Otherwise, Evernote is a fantastic mobile accessory.
3	B004LOMB2Q	its awesome love how handy it is. I'm in college right now and I use it for school, personal journal writings and devotional writings as well. I love how I can access anything any where - I LOVE it. ;)
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love the fact that I can access my notes from my tablet, phone and computer. I do wish I could access things like word and excel through the app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Excellent for jotting down ideeas or copying blurbs of information you need to refer to later. It is the besy note taking app I've used so far.
3	B004LOMB2Q	There is a good amount of space given to people who download the free app. Also this note app lets you bold, italicize, underline and create bullets in you document as well as lists you can check offThe only downfall really is that the text in the documents is always small.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app on both my cell and my tablet. Keeps all my info on all my equipment at my finger tips especially when I have to go to the parts house for replacement parts. They always want to know the make, model, serial number etc. and I have them right with me.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am so in love with this app! This is easily the best notetaker app ever. When I need to brainstorm out loud, I can record it and keep my notes. If I want a pic of a flyer for an event, I can keep a photo note. If I feel like typing, I can do that too. Best one on the market and syncs easily from my tablet (kindle) to my phone (Evo) to my computer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	With Evernote, no matter where I am, or what device I use, I can quickly jot down notes, ideas, or important info and not worry about where I saved it.  With add-ons like Skitch, I can take pictures of things that inspire my art and make notations right in the image, then Evernote once again makes sure all my devices have a copy. Brilliant!
1	B004LOMB2Q	you have to sign up for it as soon as I got it I had to delete it I was not signing up for something I will only
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is by far, one of the best apps on the Market. A must have. I have it for all of my devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is perfect for OCD people out there like me. it allows me to take notes for anything and everything. super easy to use and organize. everything is dated and easily accessable. I can link my email to it as well. its really amazing this is a free app because its so well thought out that I would even pay for it. cant say enough positive things about it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app all the time for useful info, notes, to-do lists, shopping lists, pictures, and voice memos.syncs with your Evernote account and with all of your devices
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love the functionality of this app and that I can have this information sync between my Android, Mac, and PC.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I put this app on my Fire and use it all the time, it makes things so much simpler. If you find yourself in a lot of meetings or in a class this app will work perfect for you.
3	B004LOMB2Q	its amazing. Im a college student it makes it really easy to take down notes . I can link ,record ,and even take pictures of the information and it keeps it very organized its helped me out a lot. I would highly recommend  this.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Recently tried this on Kindle and it was worth every star! Would recommend this to anyone who relies on this app for day-to-day productivity. The UI design is made fir for Kindle devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	If only the screen clipper worked with my Kindle and there were more storage for free users. But still, this is a wonderful system to integrate into your life if you're an avid note taker.
3	B004LOMB2Q	To say I love this app would be the understatement of the year. I am so much more effective than ever before. This and gtd and you are ready to live to your maximum potential.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I still kinda prefer written notes but this isn't bad. It's good for notes when you don't have a pen or paper in hand. Plus it's digital.For Pdf or docx files I still prefer dropbox.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I recommend this app with enthusiasm and confidence. You won't be sorry you tried it.I started using Evernote and it's satisfied almost all of my requirements. I needed something that was easy to use, and accessible on my work PC, Android phone, Kindle Fire, and MacBook Pro. The stall was that my work laptop is restricted for security purposes, and I was unable to install the app. (I was trying to use Google Docs, which was slower and not as user-friendly. I was uploading Word files more than I wanted, and then it was extra steps to use it on some of my other devices. And keeping my information synced was manual, which is unreliable.) I use the Web version only on my work laptop, and the installed app on my other devices.The key was &#34;jumping in with both feet&#34; first. If you use it for only some tracking things, it's just another app that you have to track. Try using it for everything, and it's brilliant.I would like to see more options in formatting.I'm using the free version, but I expect to start a paid subscription.
1	B004LOMB2Q	This has the worst permissions I have ever seen. Plus, Spiderguard detected a virus immediately after install. No thank you!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote on my Kindle Fire (original), as well as many other devices that I have. I think Evernote is great and the software is well-written and of good quality.I use it a lot for to-do lists and so having the tablet nearby is a handy way of doing quick updates to the list.Evernote are pretty innovative, which means that there are relatively frequent updates, but I am happy to put up with the slight inconvenience for the new functionality they bring out every so often.Great software.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I installed this app 1 week ago. So far I have only used it to make a shopping list and take pics with my tablet. I like the shopping list because I usually misplace my written list. With Evernote, I always have my list if I have my phone... Only thing I don't like is I haven't figured out how to delete my list yet. I think, in the future, Evernot will help me stay organized and reduce stress.
3	B004LOMB2Q	It took me a while to &#34;get into&#34; Evernote, but now that I have, I use it for everything: recipes, genealogy projects, travel plans, everything that I once would have printed or copied and kept on paper. The latest version of the app is especially well-designed. It helps a lot to read the Evernote blog and subscribe to the users' tips on how to use it to full potential.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Very robust and everything easy to use. Can be used to span multiple devices. An easy way to transfer url's or articles from one device to another.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I haven't found anything wrong with it. It saves my notes in a nice and clean way so I can find them again. It's perfect for writing stories in, and you can do so much more than that with it too.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Except that you cannot write directly on the screen, this is the best note taking app I've tried. I use it on my Kindle,  my smartphone,  and my laptop. All of my notes, drawings, web clips, and copies go here and are updated in the &quot;cloud&quot;, and appear on any device. If I have any trouble printing anything,  I copy it into Evernote, and print from there. Evernote's the best way to copy and find web pages and copy photos from the Web. I also use it for medical reviews which I take to my doctor...no misplaced paper.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app.  it is so easy to use.  I can make my grocery list at home on my Kindle Fire then use it at the store on my phone.  I preserve handwritten notes by taking pictures.  Check out Ron's Tips from the &quot;Trunk&quot;.  Every day I come up with a new use.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is very useful. I forget things so quickly sometimes and it is nice to be able to pull this up to help keep me organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've been using Evernote to sync my 3 work computers, my phone and my Kindle for over a year and I love it!  I never have  to worry about  not having info at home because  it's at school and vice versa.  However, I am concerned about the invasive  permissions.  So far I haven't seen any negative outcomes from it ...yet.  Hopefully, there won't be any.
3	B004LOMB2Q	had to wipe my kindle andlost all my notes except for the ones in this app.  def worth the price of free.  highly recommend.
3	B004LOMB2Q	For me it has been a great tool,is friendly and easy to use beyond the beauty design and presentation is useful
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is simple to use as well as easy to organise your work. it also can simply sync with all if your devises.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is quite possibly the most powerful note app I have ever used.  I have yet to find a situation in which it is not useful.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Love being able to start a note on my phone, add to it on my desktop, and then have it with me wherever I go. Great app for both the desktop and phone. Who needs random bits of paper or backs of envelopes when you can use this to create notes and THEN FIND THEM AGAIN! Priceless.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Best note program ever. I use it simultaneously on five machines! Works flawlessly and is completely flexible. Couldn't recommend it more.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is one of those cases "why didn't someone think of this sooner"Whenever I see someone enabling notes or e-mail via portable device I mention Evernote for recommendation (no i don't get paid for it) it just makes the day easier, what technology was invented for
3	B004LOMB2Q	Just started using evernote on my kindle fire...AWESOME!!!! I love that I can put items in groups so I can get right to what I am working on.  Def worth the download!
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is fantastic! I love that I can create a note on my kindle fire, and later I can use my phone to see it. Great for grocery shopping! I can keep websites that I hear, or see about for reference later...or, even keep craft ideas so that I don't forget them. A+++ for this app! -
3	B004LOMB2Q	(PC/Evo 4G/Kindle Fire) Great program for taking notes, photos etc and synching them up so they can be read on all devices. Only issue is when using Kindle Fire there are no arrow keys on their keyboard so editing is very hard unless you are very accurate fingers and are able to select where you want to edit.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I first tried this on my desktop but on the Fire it has thus far been unusable. I cannot sign in with the password I use on the desktop, cannot reset the password because it not recognize the email address, and cannot register because the same email it does not recognize is allready in use. For use on multiple devices this app is a sink hole for wasting time and effort trying to set it up.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Or maybe even get for free.  Using Evernote makes every find on the net can be stored and used and saved.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I tested Evernote,  springpad and catch.Catch cannot compete,  Springpad is a bit more intuitive but Evernote simply has the better functionality.Admitted,  it isn't  easy,  you have to sit down and study but once you've  got it there's nothing better :)
1	B004LOMB2Q	I thought that this app really sucked. It seems that the free version is extremely downgraded from the regular version. It was weird to operate it and not at all helpful, so I deleted it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is a boon for the enterprising student, college or otherwise. With the ability to create and organize notes by folder/subject, coupled with a multiple-device sharing function, keeping track of ones notes has never been easier.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is the best app for taking notes and remembering things that you just so happen to have recorded. You are given an e-mail address so you can access your notes on all of your electronic devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I'd choose this as a great note app that is so easy to use, and a nice app with many types to organize!! It's all you need in one app, Evernote!
3	B004LOMB2Q	love that I can have all my info at my fingertips wether I am using my iphone, droid, or Pc!  easy to use!
1	B004LOMB2Q	It was probably a useful app but I never found myself taking the time to give it a proper test.  I still make my shopping lists on a white dry erase board and then before leaving the house I transfer to just a paper list.  That works for me.  Just the old fashion way.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Cool This app is great!! What I like most is that you can link it to all of your devices.
3	B004LOMB2Q	So far Evernote has been the simplest and most elegant means of coordinating my random ideas between multiple platforms. Ideally I would prefer something a bit more privacy-friendly but then again is it better to have no trace at all or a trace leading those who would oppress you down a path of your choice? Secrecy isn't security. That aside I've been quite pleased so far. Good UI.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I was confused about an advertised feature, so I went to the forum to look for answers. The first post I read was aggressive, at best. It was mean, judgmental and frankly, vicious. The most aggressive responder didn't work for EverNote. She even told people to leave if they don't like it. And EverNote staff didn't do anything about her flaming.  That was enough for me. There's no way I would consider using an app that fails to stop that behavior. And there's zero chance of me supporting the app company with my hard earned dollars. Customer service is paramount, or you don't have a company.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is a great tool for organizing my life.  I love that I can upload photos and pics and add my thoughts so I remember for later.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Been using Catch for 9+ months and the ultra-simplicity grew tiresome; not to mention that the web version was changed until useless. Evernote provides all of the features and more, but is very usable and intuitive.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've had evernote for less than a week and I absolutely love it. It is the note app I needed and it syncs wonderfully to my phone and laptop.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love that it is easy, quick and organized because typing in some of the net is hard on a kindle, but it really needs an easier on the hands way to type.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this program for the ease of use and I can sync across all of my devices which is wonderful.  I have read the other reviews about permissions which sound bad but since I have not looked into this myself I can not comment on it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a very busy appl with so much to do, to search to use n I'm figuring it out as I make use of it, very good n useful appl. Highly recommend it
3	B004LOMB2Q	I started out with the smaller version and found that I was putting everything in it, from vacations to projects at work.  I add pictures of the family with vacations and weekend trips.  It's nice to add what we did during this time as I am getting older will be nice to pass down to the grandsons so they can remember where we went.This is an easy program to use and since upgrading I have added this from my phone to my computer to my Kindle fire.  the program syncs so all information is available on all devices.I recommend this to all even to students as they can keep stories and school projects on with continued updates.Thanks again Evernote.
3	B004LOMB2Q	if you're the creative type. You've been dreaming of this app. I use it to organize my stand up and music and even important serial numbers.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I am not sure how to get out of the original screen to have the notes listed in another place from the running tab on the main screen.R Elliott
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a phenomenal app for a journal. I have started to use this on my Kindle Fire and I absolutely love it!  I also have it tied to my phone as well, so I can add in photos as well as my thoughts. I have been using this more than I have been using my pen and ink journal.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app. My sister got me to try it. I didn't use it for a long time. However, in the last 6 months, I've been using it more and more rather than just bookmarking a page into my favorite/folders. There is also an Evernote for smartphones, both Android and Apple Iphones and other tablets. I have it on my Kindle as well.There are so many ways to use this app. Now, I cannot get along without it. YES, it's that good. NO, it's that GREAT! The little green elephant is now in the upper right hand corner of my address bar, and click on it and tell it to clip the page you want to save. It saves the page/information, and also the link if you need to go back to that website and do more research/reading.There is a paid version, I have not tried it---yet!  It has become almost indispensible as I do my internet research for my 'projects'.They all sync together. Easy to keep track of your pertinent webpages from device to device.
3	B004LOMB2Q	so after adding evernote to my fire, I realized I can link up to all my other devices which is handy since I have my to do list spread out it is nice to have one todo list that I can access almost anywhere (excluding non Wifi times). it also has come in handy searching websites on kindle fire and sending to my evermore where I can access on computer for further reference instead of sending a hundred individual emails I can send tons of notes which is easier for me to deal with. I do wish that if you title your note the same there should be a process that automatically combines them. seeing as it is difficult while surfing to quickly put different webpages under one note. I don't use evernote for creative ideas so all they have access to is my to do list and websites I like but I will remember in the future. now lastly the one real frustrating thing that I seem to have problems with is my evernote not displaying my notes on the phone I can access them but I wish it instantly displayed them instead of blank box that I have to open to access. also if you can have a pad on the computer like colorpad so I don't have to open evernote to see my notes. that is where Wifi only access is annoying.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Along with the windows version and the mobile version, this provides great versatility and ease of use across multiple platforms.  Don't go anywhere without it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I call it my external memory. It keeps all my notes from grocery lists t picture notes. I'd be lost without it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I need to use this app more and get familiar with it. Every web browser offers Evernote as an extension. It is a great web page clipper that does a fantastic job and I tend to forget its there. This app will be around a very long time. Updates get better and better.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Once you use it you can't do without it. There are new uses for Evernote being dreamed up every day.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evermore is proving its usefulness time and again. The convenience and time saving that it offers is significant to me in that I make notes once &amp; they are available on all my devices in almost real time. Duplication of effort is eliminated.when you use it; you will understand what I mean. There are also great tutorials to teach you how to make this tool even more useful. Don't take my word for it. use it yourself.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Very versatile, user-friendly, works great on Epic 4G and Kindle Fire. Love how it integrates into Dolphin browser, makes it very easy to save images and websites.
1	B004LOMB2Q	My Kindle keeps saying there is an available update.  However there is no way to accomplish that update. you select update, it sends you to the app store.  No kissing, that's what it does.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I liked this app at first, especially the OCR feature - but I'm finding it to be very intrusive. I installed it on my PC so I could sync my notes, and not only did it sync several times a day even when there were no new notes, it also slowed other programs down.It seems as though every time I open my Kindle there's a new update for this app. Improvements are good, but there are so many of them that it's starting to be irritating.Apps should do what they are meant to do without demanding constant attention. I'm going to look for one that stays in the background until I need it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is great, being able to cross sync phone and computer even my Kindle was a plus. This is a must try for every one.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I can't get open?  It finally crashed, bought it last March, they are sending me a new one at no charge.  They want the USB cable but I never got one when I bought it from Best Buy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote improves my life from when I get up in the morning to read reminders, to the remainder of my day when I work on and refer to notebooks and set up additional reminders.  My wife feels threatened by the attention I give Evernote.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like that I can use this across several different platforms and they all sync without problem. There are probably several other uses but I mainly just use it to sync a few notes or store stuff that I have to copy and paste on my mobile device.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I mainly use it to remind myself of things that aren't time sensitive.  That way I can go back and read my notes later.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this all on my MacBook, PC laptop, iPhone, iPad, and Kindle Fire. Write a note once and you've got it on all devices. Easy to organize your notes into notebooks. Elegantly simple.
2	B004LOMB2Q	Not really user friendly.  Hard to find how to make a new &#34;\To do list&#34;.  they should have a function where you get an automatic to do list everyday... any uncompleted items from the day before rolls over to your new list.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This product is great.  I use it all the time, if you see an article you like on the internet you can just click the evernote button and it will save it to for latter review.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is an excellent service. I hope they continue to improve their Android mobile app. I would  like a drag and drop option for moving notes. Thanks.
3	B004LOMB2Q	NOTE: Many much better writers than I have written comprehensive reviews on the service, it's clients and how best to use them, so I will focus on the client and our usage of it.I'm a big Evernote supporter and it's used heavily in all aspects of our lives. It's our journal, recipe book, repository of useful personal reference information, business receipts, etc.  Also the service and company seem to actually want you to be able to get access to your data.  Therefore the service I give 5 stars and I highly recommend everyone to give it a spin.The client I'm less enthusiastic about. My biggest complain with the Amazon App Store version is that it is behind by quite a few versions (4.4.2 versus 4.3.5 at the time of this writing), and I frequently have reminders to this effect popping up in my notifications, but once I click on them I'm prompted only to "open" Evernote.  I believe Evernote could work around this by making their particular client aware of the latest available version on a specific platform. Because of this notification issue I'm only giving the Amazon App Store version of Evernote 4 stars.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I uploaded this app to my kindle fire. I absolutely love it. it took me a second to figure out how to make new folders / notebooks but once I did I cant be stopped. I use it for recipes and poetry mainly. and its awesome so once I'm done writing a poem on my kindle I go to my computer which it is uploaded on and post it to my blog. this app is easy to use no matter what you want it for. so get it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app has been very useful. It is quick and convenient, and I love the fact that I can grab it from any of my devices and anything that I put in it is available. I use it often as a photograph link as well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evermore extensively. Keeping information from other locations is easy. Folders are easy to set up and use. More than enough space is available for home use. I would recommend Evermore to everyone. I also like the synchronization between all my computer and tablet.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this App! I use the list feature regularly, and the fact that it syncs between devices gives it 5 stars!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have discovered this program as I was looking for a way to making my job in writing easier and I must say that I am very pleased. I can now work ok my computer either locally or by the net as well as on my Kindle tablet. I am totally satisfied!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I really didn't like Evernote that much until I downloaded the Kindle app. It works awesome and syncs great! I love it
3	B004LOMB2Q	I used a lot of note writing apps on my Amazon Kindle Fire HD Tablet, but Evernote is the best!  Why?  I seen great reviews of it online, I can edit, create, and delete my notes whenever I want to; the site is simple to use, and it is so much fun!  If you are looking for a note taking app, Evernote is the one for you!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am so pleased that they added the sharing tabs. This version is the best yet! The options available are very handy and I find myself using this way more than I expected.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Have this on my computer, iPhone and PC.  Drag stuff to whatever file you want to create on Evernote and it syncs with your other stuff.
3	B004LOMB2Q	great app! it does everything. don't need so many of my other apps now that I have this. the one stop shop. I keep all my to do, rescipes, directions. you name it it has it and does it! Thank you evernote!!!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have Evernote installed on all my devices, with the sync feature I can add or update lists or take notes on any device and view any where. I use it when I go grocery shopping. You can make a list with a box to check off items!
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is great. in a freshman in highschool and use this on my kindel fire to write alllllllll my notes. thenthey are sent to my computer automattically. love this app
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote on my tablet, my phone, and my computer. Helps me keep organized. This is a useful app.  &lt;3
2	B004LOMB2Q	I can't use it and deleted from the kindle.  It is impossible to use with the kindle key board, which is too small for any kind of typing because the key board is too small.  It may import documents, but what good is that, except for reading them, when you cannot edit them with any efficiency?
3	B004LOMB2Q	This application is very useful to save article, pictures and other important subjects when I see them. Can be synchronised with my pc.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app for writing yourself reminders or just little notes on  things you observe.Kind of like writing mini notes to yourself. Its fun and easy. You can attach pictures or audio clips. Get it now!
2	B004LOMB2Q	this is a really  good note system, really like the lay out , and its easy to use, for a free its good
3	B004LOMB2Q	I Love this app! For someone as scatter brained as ME this app has proven to be a wonderful tool! Free,  generousAnd very safe! Try it and see.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I went down the list from the search &quot;notepad&quot; on Kindle Fire and Evernote is by far the very best. You can add rich text to a note which I haven't seen another app do. Thanks.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love Evernote, however, there are too many updates. Works great on kindle fire though. works well if all that you want to do is keep track of notes and stuff.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great for storing all your important information.  If I worked and wanted to have all my notes in one place, Kindle and computer, it would be great.  Nice program.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I uses this app when I first bought my kindle to keep lecture notes in a convenient place. However, the first time it tried to sync with my computer, I lost everything. Thinking it may have been a fluke, I kept trying, but it only became worse as time went on, and soon I was missing two weeks of notes. Before I even had the chance to delete the app entirely, it told me I needed to pay a hefty subscription fee, or I would lose all my notes and could not recover them. My campus doesn't have WiFi in every building, so it made using this app impossible. Do no download this if you're going to depend on it in any way with important information.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I liked Evernote so much as an app on my Kindle Fire, that I also started using it on my PC; and since they will synch with one another, what is on my PC is on my Fire.I can create a grocery, to do, or other list on my Fire while I'm watching TV at night, and then when I get up in the morning, I can quickly print out those lists on the PC and be on my way to the store, do errands, etc.I am still pretty new to the app, so maybe I will find answers I currently don't know....but I wish I had more control over the way my notes are displayed and available to me. I LOVE that I can organize my lists into categories, but I'd rather always see my lists in category view than by date created. For this reason, I gave the app 4 vs. 5 stars.
3	B004LOMB2Q	great app.  helps me remember everything and the older I get the more I need it.  love that its on Pc, kindle and phone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote and a ScanSnap scanner have allowed me to go totally paperless. I now have everything at my fingertips, 24x7.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Just brushing the surface of this powerful and useful app.  Love it's integration capabilities with multiple devices.  Really strongly recommended.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I dont leave home without it! [Literally]There's alot of imposters out there, and they all fall short. Evernote has saved my skin many times
3	B004LOMB2Q	My brother recommended this app to me.  I am really happy with how easy it is to use. I will recommend it to my friends too.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is a great app. being able to make and keep accurate notes is such a plus. I also like that it can be synced with your email. so handy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great little app with many uses.  You can even use it in your genealogy research.  It's always handy on whatever device you're using.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This has become my de facto note taker on all devices now.  So now I have consistent notes on all of my devices.  It is like Box for notes.  I do not use this to its fullest capabilities yet but I am slowing exploring it.  My fear is that I will be forced to go pro soon as my dependence continues to grow.  If, like me you live on many different devices (work computer, home computer, phone, and tablet) then this ties them all together.  Open it on any system and it synchronizes your notes together.  No it isn't a new concept but this works slicker than others I tried in the past and unlike Box, Cloud, etc. it is a note pad not a file manager.  I use both types for different reasons and the icon tells it all as to why I use Evernote.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is very handy I use it all the time especially before I go to bed. I use it for important notes and a journal. I Can't Get Enough of it I'm loving it
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love the convenience of evernote. I use it to take sermon notes, for my daily journal, for record keeping...endless possibilities.I think it is an excellent app and considering it is free, you can't lose. By far the easiest of any note or diary app as it is accessible through all devices.I wish there were a few more formatting options, like larger don't size on mobile device, and perhaps stationary, but all in all, can't be beat.
1	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote works, but the interface and simplicity get very low marks. There is so much wasted space, and instead of being focused around YOUR notes, what you spend most of your time doing is navigating between menus and looking at pre-set category icons.
3	B004LOMB2Q	A great app for all your Android devices and computer. Keep track of everything in separate notebooks and read your notes on all your devices at any time. Takes some learning to discover how useful it is, but you'll be off and running quickly. Note: keep your downloads all from the Amazon Appstore (or the other one), but don't mix them!!! They don't play well together....
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like to put stuff from other sites my grand kid's can put the pitches they take of the games they. play and the pitchers that they make on one of the painting games thank you
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great app for not only taking notes, but organizing them as well. Notes are available on virtually any Internet connected device. Suits my taste.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I confess my son put this on my kindle. It works fine Yet I forget to use it sometimes. I like my kindle and most of the apps I have on it. One of my sons put a few of the apps on it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I was first introduced to this app for my job, and now I use it everywhere I go.I use it on my Kindle, and have found it to be more than helpful at meetings.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have a terrible memory, and with Evernote I have been able to keep track of everything. I love the features and benefits to using it. The fact that you can clip from the internet is great. I am glad I stumbled upon this, and couldn't be happier.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Best not-taking app I've found for Android. I wanted something to compete with Microsoft OneNote for Windows; and EverNote was the best phone-based replacement.  Not perfect - or maybe I'm just biased after years of OneNote use - but the OneNote implementations for Android were total crap.  It took some learning adjustment but I've now got EverNote running on two or three Windows PCs, my phone, and a tablet.  Now that Evernote added a doodling feature - they call handwriting - it's much easier than before to add scribbles and drawings.
2	B004LOMB2Q	so, I have used Evernote for a number of years.  And now I keep getting a message that their is an update available, but I cannot get it to install the update.  I have even taken the suggestion to remove &amp; reinstall the app, with no change. Still receiving the update available message.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I enjoy th ability to take evernote on the go with my kindle, and find when I get home that my notes are already uploaded to my other devices that use it as well. Well organized, easy to use, and what's better is it's free. Overall, one of the best apps I've downloaded.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app works just like my iPhone app...great!! It's great for my notes and recipes. Just put them into my Evernote and I can get it on the go whenever I want.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I know I am just scratching the surface still on learning what Evermore can do but it has been useful so many times in the few weeks I have had it.I love its ease of use.  It makes sharing data between my Kindle Fire and desktop a breeze.  I used the checklist feature to prepare for a trip.  That extra bit of organization made things go so much smoother on the day we left.I definitely recommend this app.  Get it for your tablet and computer both and enjoy as it keeps your data seemlessly synced on both.  The web version lets you access your data from any Internet connected computer.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use this app all the time better then a note pad. Because I can be on my laptop working and need to remember something and can add it to a list then go to the store and have the same list on my phone to get groceries or other items. I can use it from my desktop and my kindle.
3	B004LOMB2Q	L.O.V.E. IT!!!!!!! that the only way I can discribe it!! GET IT GET IT GET IT OR LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!!!!:):)
3	B004LOMB2Q	Awesome software - available on kindle, phone and computer and notes are there for you to access and review or edit!  Love it!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Never thought I'd give up pen & paper but I have.  Evernote is handy, works well, dependable.  Not as crazy about the most recent update.  The changes were mostly cosmetic & I just don't like the looks as much, but it doesn't impact the usability.  I like the ability to sort my notes into Notebooks.  Really handy for organizing all the aspects of a busy life.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Excellent. I like the synchronous between phone, tablet, &amp; computer. plus share w the husband. We are sharing grocery lists, etc. And the synchronous is fast.
2	B004LOMB2Q	I'm not busy enough or have enough of a workload to get the full use of this app. But when I do need it, it works well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote (the FREE version) on Kindle Fire HD is absolutely invaluable. Since this computer is practically attached to my hand, where else could I keep my notes, to-do list and other similar go to items in such a simple and practical filing system? I love Evernote!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I hesitated to install Evernote because I'm not a lists type of person. But in order to keep myself on track for writing my blog entries I needed something with reminders and to not down ideas, links, add pictures, etc. And to have it sync across all my devices. This was it. It does exactly what it says it will do, keeps me in check, and I've become much better at following lists and jotting down notes. Even if you're not into checklists this will help you stay on top of everyday things. Great app and I'm so glad I finally downloaded it.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I will remove today..I've had the free version on my Kindle for about a year now.  It worked fine but now I  have been receiving an update alert almost daily for about a month now.  I will try the Spring Pad someone else suggested.  The permissions are also a concern now..YES, I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO DOES GLOSS OVER THE FINE PRINT..but I will make a new effort to be more careful..had no idea they were so sneaky.
2	B004LOMB2Q	This app is a handy little organizer. It helps me keep some things organized. Helpful for that busy person who likes to keep things in order
1	B004LOMB2Q	I didn't get to open the app. I only looked at it on amazon to find out what it was. it never even loaded on my device.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have included several important notations up to this point.i can see there are capabilities that I will use in the future.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I like the &quot;tag&quot; feature of this app.  My favorite tag is &quot;memory&quot;.  All those little sticky notes all over the house are now in my memory folder.  I have two computers and two kindles that I use for different tasks and I can access. Evermore from each electronic.  I love that I can email things to Evernote and even tag them by putting the tag file name and # at the end of the subject line.  I can customize my tags for My brain organization.
2	B004LOMB2Q	It doesn't offer as much as I would like, but it is ok for simple notes.  I would prefer it to be more a word processor.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Especially like the ability to create notes by forewarding email and clipping web pages.  Works flawlessly and the UI is pleasind.  I'm filling it up and will purchase the premium version.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Works well for what I use it for.  No complaints so far.  Look forward to more notes in the future.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is awesome-- on my Pc. The app is more limited on the kindle fire, it only copies the url not the entire page, you can attach a photo but only if you have previously downloaded it. Evernote notes you have made on your Pc are of course immediately synced to your app and the evernote universe and are easy to access. Using skitch with it is fine but not exciting in its ability. I would have not discovered all the wonderful note taking, web clipping, url grabbing features of evernote without first discovering it as an app, but it is a bit limited best for viewing your notes not creating them. For grabbing an entire web page, tagging, and making an orderly list to read the page later on your Kindle use ReadItLater. ReadItLater even auto deleted or remembers parts of the page you have already read.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am also very troubled by all the permissions that Big Bro needs to run this app.I like it's functionality but I continue to get a &quot; New Update is available&quot; only thing is it never gives me an Update option - It just brings me to the app page and where Update should be - it only gives me the option to &quot;Open&quot;. I have uninstalled/reinstalled it but that makes no difference. When I check for updates from within the app itself - is says a new update is available but gives me no option to update. With those 2 problems,I still use it daily...but frustratedly.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Honestly, no review I just think it deserves 5 stars so la la la la la la la la la
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is the BEST notepad available! !!  Can be used on any android device and also accessed on  a PC! This is such a fntastic application.  Clipping from the web, picture notes, &amp; drawings. Tags, Edit, they thought of it all.  I will never stray and might even end up paying for the upgrade one day for more space.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is my life saver! I use this all the time, I can access it from my phone, kindle fire, and from my computer. It really helps that I can have special or certain notes all the time.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Have tried them all and there is a reason that Evernote is the flagship. They continually innovate and there is not a device or browser that they are not available on. Even have a plugin for Outlook. They handle attachments and both the tagging and merging of notes.You can also save any or all your notebooks offline. You can even export your data if you desire. The free service is a great way to test the waters, took me less then a year to subscribe. Heavy or dedicated users will find much benefit and value from the paid service.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have been using it less than a week and I have already created 9 specific use Notebooks! I have a notebook for grocery lists, gift lists, Bible study notes, recipes, local nonlinear restaurant menus, and more! Fantastic App! And I am still a #NewB!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I tried to use this and kept getting an invalid password error message.  Not what I wanted, because it is too much trouble.  I am giving it 4 stars because it may just be my impatience to deal with it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I got this app on a recommendation from an article I read out of curiosity. I never thought I would use it as much as I do, but I don't do much of anything without noting it in Evernote, and I have only skimmed the surface of what it can do. Lists, voice recordings, photos, and sharing notes with friends...it does it all. One of my favorite apps.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I find this app extremely useful for taking down my church notes instead of carrying books or several android tabs around. I can confidently do everything with my kindle & store in evernote then retrieve it later either on my phone or computer. Comes in really handy for sharing notes too.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I track my weight with it for dialysis and this makes it simple. I can have it all in one place. no need to figure out where things are!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Really, this must be the easiest tool in the world for saving stuff that I need to use later or just want to read later. I originally downloaded it for personal use, but have started using it for business as well. It's amazing how easily I can find information saved to Evernote. And I love that it works pretty much the same across all platforms, so I can go from my Windows computer to my Android tablet and still access my information whenever I need to. Just a great app!
2	B004LOMB2Q	I have evernote on all my devices so I can see notes regardless of which device I am using. There are better Apps out there, in particular Noteworthy, among others.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have a PC, a kindle, and an iPhone.  Wherever I am, whenever I think of something, I'm likely to have one of these devices at hand.  With evernote, I can access whatever I need, wherever I am.  It's not at all the best for creating lists, or web clipping, or taking notes, or anything really, but I use it almost exclusively because I know I can get to my notes when I need them.  It's much better than having an excellent notes program that's only on my PC, or a great list manager that's only on the iPhone.  That's why I ditched the other apps and use evernote for everything I can. And it's free.  What more could you ask for?
3	B004LOMB2Q	I am keeping a daily log....due to a back injury, so far its been the best thing I have found to keep this log without having to write it down manually in a note book, I know there has to be more uses and abilities that this app can do but I haven't been able to find any instructions, manuals, or videos of its true application or abilities.  I know or feel that there is more that it can do but have no idea how to use it to its full capacity and I truly would like to know. I hope that the designers of this application will come out with a video possibly on Youtube or a manual that will show all of its uses and let those of us using this app know where to get a copy of the manual or were to go watch its video.  So we can all be proficient users of Evermore.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love the concept, but for me, dropbox is a little easier to use. I think if I needed to take a lot of business files with me and I was using it for a professional capacity it would be great, but a little bit too much for what I use it for.
3	B004LOMB2Q	love taking seminar notes, especially with gesture typing, and having all my notesin the cloud. i can leave the notepads and just use phone.
3	B004LOMB2Q	notes are accessable regardless of OS or device. which is great, web, fire, phone or windows os. would get 5 stars but the web version can get flakey sometimes. Recomend adding notes via the fire, or windows program(available for Mac too). Also only premium version has a go back button incase you need to go back to previous version of your note. Premium version is subscription based, which I'm not a fan of. But in all a great note taking program.
1	B004LOMB2Q	I see no reason to waste my time for this type of null applications. I wonder how it got 4.5 stars and I see only one or two stars recently.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I Installed this on the computer, kindle fire, and two phones. I love the ability to make a shopping list and my husband will get it at the store.
3	B004LOMB2Q	App has been invaluable to me in keeping track of certain articles as well as being able to send them to my different email sites.  I have had it for several months.  It works well with my Kindle Fire.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I recently had an issue using the app on the Kindle Fire, and the customer service people fixes the issue prompto and apologized profusely for the issues! I love this app, and it's so great to see such friendly costumer service!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love the ease of using it. Just being able to write something on the fly or record a thought or picture makes it worth having. I use it for journaling and making lists.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote has so many options in creating to-do lists, even with check off markers, categories, and the ability to add photos! It syncs with all your android apps, so you can access your notes on your Kindle as well as your phone! Works flawlessly on both my Kindle Fire HD and my HTC Evo 4G! This is my most accessed app and would recommend to everyone!  (Note: this is the first review I've ever written and the first I've felt the need to share my opinion. That says a lot about how much I love this app!)
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is always one of the first apps I install. What's better is that this version for the Kindle Fire is the tablet version. Much better!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great application for Bible studying! I use it often while talking notes, and its great for sharing information with others as well. thanks!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Life is easier with this app. Now I can be carefully organized everywhere I go and have fast access to my notes at all times
3	B004LOMB2Q	I don't see why everyone is so against this app. I love it! It gives a really organized system for note keeping. Although I don't personally use it, you are able to upload photos, audio, and locations pretty easily. At first, it may all seem overwhelming when you download the app, but once you figure it out, its really great! Scroll past all of the negative comments and you will see a lot of people agree with me. I haven't had any privacy problem at all, and heck, its FREE, so there is nothing to lose really.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evermore is perfect for capturing just about everything - inspirational quotes, notes to myself, etc.  The only downside is that on my kindle fire I can only save links instead of saving the text of a web page.  But O can save the link here, then to to my computer and sync Evernote then visit the links and on my computer I can clip the text of that page.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote has allowed me to organize and keep track of all aspects of my job. I don't have to lug around my laptop. The time spent thumbing through note books is gone. Weather at home on the road or in the office all my notes are there with me. Must have.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love using this app when I attend a meeting or church service.  It is a great tool for taking notes!Highly recommended!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I was pleasantly surprised to see this app on my Kindle Fire HD.  I love the app on the smart phone, hope it works as well on Kindle.  Only draw back I can see right now is the fact that with my phone I can include a picture with a particular note.  I suppose I can still do that only will have to import a picture from the Amazon Cloud first.  Looking forward to a lot of good use from this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have this app for my computer, phone, and kindle fire and its awesome. Very good note organizing tool for students...
3	B004LOMB2Q	I LOVE this app. I have it on my kindle fire and my aneroid phone. I like that my notes appear on both devices and sync together anytime I make a change! On my aneroid I also downloaded the Skitch app which makes the snapshot function on my Evernote so much more fun! :) GREAT APP!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app because I can sync my information with my laptop. I can add music, notes, pictures, and record voice memos. This app is very handy.
3	B004LOMB2Q	super useful
3	B004LOMB2Q	It is good but it needs a little work. There are a few glitches but it is a good app
1	B004LOMB2Q	Evernote is like a bait and switch product. I wouldn't bother with it, time-wise. The devices apps are designed for should be what they are intended to be - simple, easy to use, quick, and accurate. That answers my view of this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This is the greatest. I love the idea of this and I use it constantly. Seriously a great app. Don't know what I'd do without it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Not really ready to review this app, but don't want to be nagged in the app, so this is what they get
3	B004LOMB2Q	Works &amp; syncs across all forms of media for free?! Who could ask for anything more! I've put more than a few. office managers and tech savants onto it.I can't believe they had never heard of it ... Too cool for school
3	B004LOMB2Q	This are great words to describe Evernote. It's definitely an application one must have. Allows you to be syncronized with documents -notes, pictures, etc- in all the electronical devices with Evernote installed. Most importantly it is easy to use, quick to access and has a great interface. I simply love it. Go ahead and give it a try.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Great for notes on demand.  This is a good idea to have a good os every other day. I am a danger to Paul?
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote daily for personal and work stuff I want to keep track of. Its well designed and makes it easy to create or edit content on one device (pics, screenshots, writing, web pages) and then retrieve and use it on another. You store stuff in &quot;notebooks&quot; that can have sub notebooks. Pretty usefull especially for capturing random thoughts and keeping them organized.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I have tried at least a half dozen list apps, and never liked any of them.  Then one day, I asked on my facebook what list app my friends were using.  The almost unanimous answer was Evernote.I downloaded the app, and have loved it ever since.I love the ability to sync between all devices.  The only bad part of that was that it wore down the battery on my cell phone in only 8 hours.  The fix was easy, and now it just syncs once a day unless I push an important sync through.This is the last list app I will ever need!
3	B004LOMB2Q	Its a great product for keeping notes.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and I use it to keep notes for writing projects.  It syncs with my home desktop version so I don't have to transfer between devices by email.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Mentally Challenged by Pain medicines, Evernote is my memory augmentation device. At least until the wonderful bio-Implants are free or cheap as Evernote! . (:-{)}
3	B004LOMB2Q	this app is great for notes and memos.  I have it installed on two computers, phone, ipod touch and kindle fire.I can share information across all devices!try it out it is a great app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Wow! What else can I say that can express my appreciation for this app.I thank God that He endows people with imagination and the knowledge to create and bring into reality what is in the spiritual realm convenience and order, God is a God of order and this app helps put my thoughts in order, organze my written work both personal and spiritual. But I do wish I can delete a notebook. All in all it is a great app to have, work with, and use. I also have it on my iphone where I can dictate notes because I can easily forget what's on my mind. TGBTG.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use Evernote on my Kindle Fire and PC without problem.  Granted, I am not pounding out copious notes, but the app functions fine for me.I believe many/most of the privacy concerns would be satisfied by reading the message posted on the web site regarding Evernote's use of an off-site backup service.  (Certainly worth researching since so many people have commented about privacy concerns.)
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love Evernote! It does what I can't do with other lists on my Kindle Fire. I never lose the list just because I'm not on a wifi connection at the time I want to check the list.  I can organize all my hobbies in their own unique folder; keep pictures of ideas for decorating; keep urls for websites I want to return to for supplies; and even keep my archived emails from my ancestry research.It's a wonderful assistant to all my projects.
3	B004LOMB2Q	combined with kindle fire and chrome EVERNOTE web clipper app, I can easily organize anything I wanna save and take with me. nice interface as well.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I don't have this app but I was thinking of downloading it. I was reading reviews, and y'all are harsh. I personally don't mind if they need all those permissions. but, once toy create a note, can you convert it into a regular document and email it to the average computer/laptop? Because that's what I need.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I love this app.. I add thoughts, pictures, recipes,  and so forth and it is very organized. I love that its on both on my phone and kindle.
3	B004LOMB2Q	this is such a great app to organize yourself although I would love it if they would ad a calendar feature
3	B004LOMB2Q	I've had app for about 3 week and so far...no problems. It regularly syncs with my laptop and saves everything I have asked including audio notes. Very convenient.
3	B004LOMB2Q	(I will come back and get into details)The typing of notes is super fast on the kindle because of the swipe keyboard ability, something Apple does not offer. You can organise all your notes into notebooks and you can add tags for easy searching options later on.My major complain is that after I have entered a statement it is hard to edit the whole thing to bold or underline, highlighting more than one word seems impossible. Maybe I am not doing something right. I will get back to this review shortly.
3	B004LOMB2Q	Awesome! PERFECT! Exactly what I was looking for :) Perfect for lists and anything else you can think of. Sharing with friends is easy to do too. Love love love love love
3	B004LOMB2Q	if you don't use this app you really should... don't know what else to say. no matter where you are there's practically guaranteed to be a device that runs this and the ii design is excellent. No more notepads for me!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I use evernote to take notes in class. I can create notes before meetings on my desktop and make minor edits in class and meetings.
3	B004LOMB2Q	hey I love evernote!!!! Before this I was using notepad but moving on to evernote...one of the best choices I've ever made. On evernote you can have separate notebooks so now I don't have all my story chapters mashed together, they're organized!!! Also the bullets and numbers and bold, italics and underlines are something notepad didn't have. I love evernote!!!!!
3	B004LOMB2Q	I never needed a premium account, so this app works out great for school and personal projects. It never crashed me and works better for me than most note taking apps.
3	B004LOMB2Q	I gave this product a try for keeping some of my notes and found to my happy surprise that it is a wonderful complex app that does so much more than I can mention here. I am still learning all the useful things it enables me to do. I love it! I have made a really great recipe file that I plan on using a lot. I have also created many notebooks that will help me to organize my life. I love the photo and web clipping features. It is a very worthwhile app to use and it is well worth your consideration. The upgrade works out to be a little less than $4 a month and is worth it.
3	B004LOMB2Q	This app is easy to use and smart. The way it's organised is really easy. I have no trouble using this app.
3	B004LOMB2Q	great app! use it all the time on my kindle fire and doesn't freeze or crash! great for typing long stories or papers!
3	B004LORZCW	I chose this live wallpaper because it's one of the few that will work on my Sony Google TV. It looks great and allows me to show off my set. I'll probably grab the pay version later.
3	B004LORZCW	If you are interested in astronomy, then you will like this, I find it nicer then a still astronomy photo.
3	B004LORZCW	I really loved the affects of this background on my phone. It didn't seem to take up too much of my batter. You can change the galaxy scene, the colors and customize, but it otherwise has limitations unless you want to buy the full package. I got the free version. I'll use it again.
3	B004LORZCW	This is the best live wallpaper out there IMO.  I have always enjoyed space related content and when I got my Android phone (Nexus 4) I had to have this wallpaper.  It is so realistic and I have spent time just watching the stars slowly turning.  At first I ran the free version but eventually I wanted to adjust the settings.  At the time of this review I am now enjoying the nebula which is also very eye catching.  It is just an awesome live wallpaper and it doesn't request overreaching permissions.  Thanks Kittehface Software!
3	B004LORZCW	By far the best live wallpaper I have had. Awesome customization options. Not a huge battery drainer either. Worth paying for.
3	B004LORZCW	This app runs great on my htc amaze 4g. Has a ton of different settings to customize so you can get exactly the look you want. Is also interactive and movie with touch or phone movement.
3	B004LORZCW	I really like this wallpaper. It moves slow enough that it doesn't use a lot of battery life, but enough that it will catch people's attention. I can't wait for my nephew to buy his new phone so he can download it.
3	B004LORZCW	This is the third live wallpaper I have purchased from Kittehface and this is without even checking out the free one. Why? Because I know two things about their live wallpaper apps. One, they look awesome with lots of attention to detail. Second, they are low impact on performance and battery life. Just the way every live wallpaper should be. Thanks for being awesome Kittehface!
3	B004LORZCW	this wallpaper is gorgeous. running it on a galaxy s4 and the lock screen is interactive with air gestures. nice. (:
3	B004LORZCW	I tried a few other live wallpapers, but I found them to be resource intensive and battery draining.  This live wallpaper uses little resources and battery which is exactly what I wanted!  Hoping improvements to come in the future to improve higher picture quality, but since it runs behind my buttons and makes a great back drop, I'm completely satisfied!
3	B004LORZCW	This works great on my Samsung Tab 2..you have four active screen savers to pick from with lots of settings to get just the way you want it to look and a slide show of your photos is also among the choices for your background...very cool!
3	B004LORZCW	My sweetie and I both agreed on this wallpaper for our shared tablet.  Its fun it responds to touch and relaxing in a way.
3	B004LPBTAA	I compared all the sudoku games I downloaded as a FATD - this one wins hands down...... ... ... ..
3	B004LPBTAA	I am a Sudoku beginner but I play all the games available by 'cheating hints until I can solve the puzzle. By playing that way I am learning a lot more about how to play. I am truly addicted now.
3	B004LPBTAA	I put this on the Kindle just to keep the kids busy when they having nothing to do in the car. They said they like it.
3	B004LPBTAA	I really like the format--how it operates. The only thing I don't like about it is some of the harder puzzles you have to solve by process of elimination instead of logic. One puzzle had two solutions. Still the format is the best one I have ever used.
3	B004LPBTAA	I have played Sudoku on many different levels, and this is the finest on line application that I have found.  Truly outstanding
3	B004LPBTAA	I find this game to be very user friendly, it teaches you how to play even the most difficult puzzles and easy to mark off your indefinite spots and other features that made me throw away my pencil to do the newspaper puzzle
3	B004LPBTAA	This program is easy to use for players at all levels of skill. The hints are helpful if you get stuck, and the program keeps track of your statistics for you also. The free version only lets you play one puzzle at each level every day, but there are ten (I think) daily.
3	B004LPBTAA	I enjoy the lerning experience from the detailed hints.  I've done sudoku for a long time, but the tutorials on some patterns I haven't noticed are great, not only do they point out the patterns, but explain why that particular pattern will result in an elimination of a possibility.
3	B004LPBTAA	I play this game whenever I need a time out. I totally loose myself in the numbers. It's a very user friendly version. I love it!!!
3	B004LPBTAA	I have used at least a half dozen sudoku apps (and even enjoyed some enough to give positive reviews). This app is so much better than the rest that I bought the paid version just because I believe the developer has earned it. The layout works well and you can customize the interface to work the way YOU want. That is nice. What sets this apart is the hint system. It's not about solving the puzzle you are working on, but learning HOW to solve so you can do it yourself in the future. When I first started using the app I was working (and struggling) at the Intricate difficulty level (there are 13 levels of difficulty - Intricate is 7th). Now I'm regularly working at Annoying (9th) and can make serious attempts at Devious (10) and Fiendish (11). I subscribe to the saying "Give a man a fish, he eats for a day, teach a man to fish and he eats for a lifetime." This app teaches you how to complete puzzles using the most advanced logic. And it's FREE! Very highly recommended!
1	B004LPBTAA	I feel that this sudoku is very hard to play as the hint numbers are hard to enter as they constantly are changing when you put operators in other cells.
1	B004LPBTAA	I didn't like this one, mainly because I couldn't choose the options I would have liked.  Seemed either too hard or I just didn't figure it out.
3	B004LPBTAA	I really like working the Sudoku puzzles.  I appreciate that there are games of all different levels and continue to challenge myself with the more difficult levels.  Thank goodness there are hints when I get completely stuck.
3	B004LPBTAA	I have been in love with Sudoku from the very start and having it so available at any given time is great.Anyone who enjoy Sudoku will find this very enjoyable.
3	B004LPBTAA	I learned so much from this soduku app that I had to purchase the next one because I played all I could on beginning free app. Worth every minute and dime. Really a wonderful learning tool for those that want to understand "how to play" in dept.
3	B004LPBTAA	While the cover menu is not impressive, the game plays very well. Many different levels of challenge and (so far) endless puzzle at each level. Highly recommend this game to others.
3	B004LPBTAA	I've been playing this one a long time and it is the one you want. In fact, it's one of the very few apps I have switched over to the paid version. Pencil function is great, easy to reset if needed. Highly recommend!
3	B004LPBTAA	I play this almost every day.  I am closing in on 60 years of age, and like to keep my mind active.  This is easy to read and understand, I like that when I feel like it I can add ALL the pencil marks and go from there.  It is clean looking and the harder levels really are harder.
3	B004LPBTAA	This FREE one was so good, I felt guilty playing the free version.  I bought the $2.99 paid version this morning and will post a review in a few weeks.PROSTutorial and Reference to Solving TechniquesTeaching HintsFull Range of Difficulty (&#34;Easiest&#34; to &#34;Nightmare&#34;)Auto Pencil Marks (must have)Compact (1.4 Mb)Plenty of Sudoku (Daily - 1 each of 13 Levels)CONSnone
3	B004LPBTAA	i like this software because it provides statistics for you at the end of each puzzle.  it compares your completion time with others who have completed the same puzzle.  pretty cool!  it worked fine and without problems on my Fire device.
3	B004LPBTAA	I absolutely love this Sudoku app. This is the most complete and helpful Sudoku app I have ever had. I have learned quite a few better methods for trying to solve puzzles instead of just muddling through them.Pros:*Very readable - all numbers and pencil marks are easily readable (no so with some apps)*Hints - they don't just give you one of the squares - it gives you a row/column/cube to "meditate" upon or look closely at. If you don't quite get it right off it gives you a further hint. And then finally, actually produces the hint. You can also request it to solve a square if needed.*Learn - it gives you some of the methodology to solving the puzzles.*FREE - a great free appCons:Can't think of a single one
3	B004LPBTAA	New games daily!  Always a challenge since you choose the levels that you feel like playing depending upon your mood or how much time you have.
3	B004LPBTAA	I am really enjoying this App.  So far this the best one I've found with new puzzles everyday and all levels.  It's encouraging to see the advancement from the low levels into higher ones.  Great app!
3	B004LPBTAA	Love it. Fun with numbers and the his are very helpful if you get stuck. Many levels with graduating difficulty. Start with the easy ones or go straight to the harder puzzles.
3	B004LPBTAA	Had it on my cell phone (Android) and had to get it for my kindle.  Play levels that range from very easy to nightmare.  Very challenging game, but a very easy to master how to play.
3	B004LPBTAA	Of all the Suduku games I've tried I like this one best because it is easy to use and can be set in a challenging mode when needed too. The background scene is nice to look at and relaxing too.
3	B004LPBTAA	Enjoy Sudoku Daily  by Jason Linhart works better than the newspaper versions. I especially like the way the hint works in two stages when I am stuck.
3	B004LPBTAA	I play this game every day. The game is easy on the eyes. In my opinion, it is a keeper! You can play any level from easy to challenging.
3	B004LPBTAA	I love sudoku. It is very challenging to find a game that is difficult enough to enjoy. Most apps (and store bought books) are waaaaay to simplistic. This app is wonderful, every day I have a new nightmarishly difficult puzzle to keep my skills sharp. Some days I play all 16 difficulty levels. This app has enough settings that every skill level can find a daily puzzle to enjoy. Happy solving, everyone!
3	B004LPBTAA	fun, fun
3	B004LPBTAA	i love this app! you get new puzzles everyday from simple to nightmare, its fun and it gives you hints when your stuck!
3	B004LPBTAA	One of the best sudoku games available.  Wish there were more than one a day, so I sometimes play the same game again!
3	B004LPBTAA	I don't watch tv nearly as often.  I love Sudoku and this is handy and easy to use.  It makes my day
3	B004LPBTAA	I have tried to find a sudoku as good as this to no avail. both simple to use,  and complex as you get better (e.g., learn function). also awesome on ipad. &quot;Free &quot; gets you 1/day of each level, with lots of levels. if u want more, you'll need to pay 2 bucks.
3	B004LPBTAA	This game is very enjoyable. I like that I can choose the difficulty and it is so much easier to make choices than a paper game
3	B004LT7OSM	This app was well worth the $1 price tag to liven up my HTC ThunderBolt. it offers different settings and options to customize it to your liking as well.
3	B004LT7OSM	Quick, easy to install and customize. I like it a lot on my HTC Droid Incredible. Realistic, too. Looks good, like the real thing. Nice change from static wallpapers.
3	B004LT7OSM	This app looks great on my phone (Samsung Epic). This developer makes the best live wallpapers on the market hands down. I recommend then all.
3	B004LT7OSM	I love the customization available with this wallpaper. Looks great on my phone although I would prefer a higher resolution. Clouds look a tad grainy.
2	B004LT7OSM	What can I say - it works great. My weather app does the same thing basically but this keeps the lightning going if your in that mood.
1	B004LT7OSM	I Have never been able to get it on my Kindle. It downloaded but when I got a replacement Kindle, it never came back.
1	B004LT7OSM	as soon as I try to preview the wallpaper it forecloses every time. even if I select wait, it will never load waste of money. htc amaze 4g.
3	B004LT7OSM	I originaly reviewed this stating that I never got the app, but I was wrong.  Error on my part and I finally found it on the phone...Usually easier to locate as soon as I log into the app store.Works as designed, nice touches with the color of lightning changes and timing.It IS Worth the .99 cents.
3	B004LT7OSM	I love this wallpaper! In fact, I have almost every one of this developer's live wallpapers. I have found they are the smoothest and best looking of the wallpapers I've found so far. With the thunderstorm wallpaper, I especially love the customization - colors, lightning strikes, rain, etc. absolutely awesome.
2	B004LT7OSM	Thunderstorms is one of the cooliest live wallpapers you can download, especially the paid version. you can tweak the clouds, lighting, and the ambient light to your liking. great stuff!there is always a but...after I applied this live wallpaper, I watched the CPU usage and the battery drain very closely. not too bad in those areas. however I am suspecting that this live wallpaper conflicts with something running on my Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket....why? because after applying Thunderstorms, my skyrocket will become randomly laggy. once it becomes laggy, it wont quickly free itself up. so laggy it would be unresponsive to my home button being pushed or the power button. to free the phone in a timely fashion I would have to pull the battery. again, this would be random, most of the time Thunderstorms would be awesome!I disabled Thunderstorms an applied &quot;Microbes&quot; live wallpaper (my favorite) and my Skyrocket hasn't become unresponsive again. after a few days of I will put back on Thunderstorms to see what happens and report back.
3	B004LT9E8U	This beautiful  Live Wall paper is the best I've ever seen. Lots of features including Santa appearances that occur more often toward christmas, and the ability to have the background change appearance based on the time of the day. Only problem was that it was a big sluggish when I first loaded the wall paper. But things seem to be working now, so I love it! Thanks!
3	B004LT9E8U	You can customize it. Alot of options. Very pretty scene. Great for the Holidays. You can also see Santa. Very cool
1	B004LT9E8U	Watching snowfall alone would be pretty, so I tried this, but that's not an option. It looks like an earthquake in the snow. Way too much going on. Uninstall.
2	B004LT9E8U	Overall I thought this live wallpaper was a little dull, but it was a FAOTD and I will not complain too much giving me a free $0.99 app.  I did use it during the winter and it did not seem to drain the batter any great amount.  Overall, not a bad app, just not a great one.
3	B004LT9E8U	Great app. With alot of settings. And a choice of santa flying, and lights on the trees. Great change of pace for all seasons. Well worth the .99 cents.
3	B004LT9E8U	I was not looking for a wallpaper app. This one popped up as a highly rated app so, on a whim, I bought it. All I can say is...wow. It is stunningly beautiful. I do not have a 3D phone, yet the trees look 3D! There are so many customization options. Background colors, amount and shape of snowflakes, Christmas lights, Santa sightings... The Developer packed a lot into a .99&cent; app.  Definitely worth 5 stars in my book.
3	B004LT9E8U	This is a beautiful theme that doesn't suck to much battery. Lots of customization options &amp; a little bit of holiday cheer.
3	B004LT9E8U	Customization options are plentiful and great. Wallpaper looks great on my phone and will look spectacular at Christmas time. I really like all the papers this developer offers!
3	B004LT9E8U	I like that you can have effects in the background or add lights to the trees.  It's really a beautiful wallpaper.  I leave it on when I dock and charge my Toshiba Thrive so it doesn't use up the battery.
3	B004LT9E8U	Every LWP I've gotten from this dev just rocks!  The swaying, snowy trees in this one are beautiful, as is the huge moon w/the nearby aurora.  and, as always, you can put almost all of it on sd! (very much appreciated as some devs don't provide this option.)  Like others, I've not yet seen Santa tho. :(  lol.  LG Optimus V
3	B004LT9E8U	I put this one on my phone. I am very happy with the entire scenery. I love the way the trees move and the snow fall. The reason I looooove this one is because I live in Florida. Hehehe! Love it.
3	B004LT9E8U	This live wallpaper has a great default setting which makes the background sky change with the time of the day. Alternatively, the sky can be set manually to mimic dawn, noon, sunset, and night, or anything in between with a user-definable color palette. The settings for the snow fall make the snow fall realistic. As it gets closer to Christmas I will enable the Christmas lights,  and Santa Claus settings to being in the festivities! All around this its a delightful app.
1	B004LT9E8U	There is absolutely no reason for a live wall paper to track my location.  Dev, why the spying?  If it is to dynamically change the background then use the system clock.
2	B004LT9E8U	the wallpaper is gorgeous. but on my Samsung galaxy 7.0 plus the scene wont scroll like it does on my phone.can the developer fix?
3	B004LT9E8U	This app is incredibly high quality for 10 cents.  Cannot recommend it enough.  I'll definitely be using this every Christmas season.
2	B004LT9E8U	i saw this for 0.10&cent; and got it. they upped the price to  .99 when i bought it, and it is quite slow on my original Samsung Fascinate. disappointed.
1	B004LT9E8U	Unfortunately this never downloaded on my Android phone. I wish it would have. I did pay for it I'm sorry to say.
3	B004LUEFUQ	The tarot option only deals with the Major Arcana, and the deck used is an old French one. That aside, it is amusing to see if the readings actually add up to the days events.
2	B004LUEFUQ	This app worked fine on my kindle fire. Only had one polyp ad but was able to skip through it easily. The horoscopes seem pretty general, nothing specific given but that's to be expected. The tarot reading was a nice bonus. I can't say for sure I'll keep this app a long time but it's fun to look at until I need the space for something better.
1	B004LUEFUQ	I'll admit that I've followed my horoscope for quite awhile now for entertainment.  Though I don't believe in it in any serious way, I always find it interesting to see if anything in my day matches up (spoiler alert: not often).  The nice thing about this app is it has both a horoscope and a quick tarot card section as well.  Both seem to do what they are supposed to, but the app on Kindle Fire is really bad looking.  It's obviously been sized for mobile phones so it doesn't fill the screen properly.  Also, the horoscope text is white and the background is very light, making it difficult to read the first couple sentences.  If the interface was updated for KF I would raise my rating.  It's really a 3 and a half.  It's free, so I really shouldn't be complaining, but that's my review.  ;)
3	B004LUEFUQ	I'm liking this app. alot! I like the graphics &amp; it posts to Facebook seamlessly. I don't want alot of in-depth analysis- &quot;just the facts, m'am &quot;. It's everything I wanted. Can't believe it's FREE!!
3	B004LUEFUQ	I have a kindle fire HD and this app works just fine on it. Works equally as well on my phone also. Never had an issue with the adds ... guess I'm just lucky. Anyway, both my horoscope and tarot reading seem to line up perfectly with my life. Although I know it's for entertainment purposes only, I still check it every morning! Download and use it with an open mind and enjoy it!!
3	B004LUEFUQ	I use this quick and easy horoscope every day. It is clear and understandable with a nice variety of vocabulary and the advice is often right on target. It is visually pleasing, and easy to navigate. I can recommend this for anyone who enjoys getting a quick read on the day ahead.
3	B004LUEFUQ	Some parts of the app have the text in white letters with some backgrounds (light blue) making it difficult to read.  They are cute horoscopes though, and its fun to use while waiting around with friends.
1	B004LUEFUQ	Terribly written horoscopes! Predictions were weak, very bland, overly generic, & badly worded.  And the tarot deck it uses is so deeply obscure with its unnumbered & unnamed cards, I could not even tell which cards 2 of the 3 even were.  To find out what cards it's showing you, you have to pay...There are much better free apps available for both horoscopes & tarot than this one.  It was so bad, I deleted it off my KF tablet & out of my Cloud.
1	B004LUEFUQ	I would probably like this app if they would fix the background or use black lettering. Don't waste you time downloading it until they do something with it.
1	B004LUS390	the latest update has ruined it and it is no longer working on kindle fire! loops on start up and force closes!
3	B004LUS390	amazing.  I've been using the Free version firva long time and have to say this is one of the best apps on both android and ios.  Great job on this.  Now just wish there were some tutorials also.
3	B004LUS390	I love to draw. this app really lets me be creative. just one thing, I cant send it... I use this on a kindle fire and I really wanted to send a picture to a friend. I can not. if I could I would give this 5 stars hands down. maybe an update could fix this. either way I recommend the 2 dollars to buy this version.
3	B004LUS390	Sketch book mobile is the best sketch and paint app on Android. If you dnt have it get it. Paint, sketch and have fun creatin your own wp :))
3	B004LUS390	Thank you amazon... This is best free app of the day so far  thanks a lot. This is one of the best app around for android.
3	B004LUS390	they crossed out 99 cents and made it 1.99? I've never seen a sale like that before, but okay.. haha
3	B004LUS390	This app was great in Express version, but now that I've purchased it it doesn't work. it loops at the start through the agreement screen. it crashes when I touch the screen during the quick tour. I can't even  draw on here.I have the full scale Pc version already so I hope they fix this.EDITEDOur works now! I've made some excellent paintings using this app. Some even printed. Very nice app.
3	B004LUS390	Can they seriously fit so many features into one mobile app?  I mean, layers, brushes, undo/redo, transparency...geez... and it all works flawlessly.
3	B004LUS390	very neat app. lots of variety and flexibility with drawing tools.  definitely will be playing more with this. HTC Evo 4G
3	B004LUS390	I used the express version for a few days, and loved it, and when this app went on sale, I had to snap it up. Even at full price it will pay for itself immediately, as a good Sketchbook and pencils costs more than this app.pros : easy interface,  easy Color wheel, perfect tool selection, and very sensitive on kindle fire.cons : cannot name saved sketch , can become unresponsive in 32 Colorado mode.
3	B004LUS390	This app has app a beautiful, dedicated UI, making it simple to use and the settings are great. Few more settings and this'll be perfect!!
1	B004LUS390	This app clearly isn't optimized for the Fire. it used to work but the color picker didn't work, and it would crash when trying to open a file. And now it crashes 5 seconds after opening since the new update. Do not waste your money on this crap until they fix it
3	B004LUS390	You can have many different layers of drawings. So you can have a picture as a layer then trace it on another layer and color on another. You can make any one of the layers invisible by clicking the eye next to it.  You can choose all your colors during the wheel or saved Colorado an eye dropper thing that means you can copy colors, that is not in the free version..  There are more brush options than the free version. (The free version is fantastic too)  this app takes about five minutes to get used to during and then you are set.  I am an artist and I love it. Worth buying!
3	B004LUS390	This app is well worth the dollar, maybe more. Amazing sketch/doodling capability with a wide variety of brush strokes and sizes. Text can be entered and rotated, same can be done with the sketch you have drawn. Best of all there are 6 layers that can be added (more would have been better but one cannot complain too much)  and shown/hidden just like photoshop. This just increases the capability of this app as one can load a photo in one layer and increase its transperancy to sketch over it in another layer. Nuf said. Works without any force close issues on the xoom and looks good too.
3	B004LUS390	works wonderful on my kindle fire. draw on it everyday.got to get if love drawing. :) :) . . . .
3	B004LUS390	I love using this app! It's really very awesome once you get the hang of it! I can't stop using it now!
3	B004LUS390	i was scared to buy this, because everyone was saying it doesnt work on the kindle fire. but i did, and it works really well. its a little confusing at first, but then you get the hang of it
1	B004LUS390	Id give this zero stars if I could.  Worked for ONE sketch then refused to load gallery pics after.  Force closes every time I try to load.  Tried uwninstall technique but wont even reinstall now.  A complete waste of my money.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app! it is similar to the traditional desktop paint. But portable! It is so cool because you can add and remove individual layers. there are many different art tools to choose from. At first it was hard to understand, because there is no tutorial. But I figured it out and it is now one of my favorite apps! Definately worth the two dollars.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app. I had the free version and I liked it enough that I bought the paid version (well worth the cost) and I even went as far as to buy the full program for computer! The app gives you plenty of brush options (about 45 brushes I think?), layers and has all the settings I need for my sketches. For such a low price this is a fairly powerful little tool!Some people complain about the screen size of using this app on a phone, personally i use a Samsung S4 which has a decent size screen (5 inches) and I formally used a Samsung Droid Charge (4.3 inch screen) and I never had a problem with drawing with my fingers. I do have a cheap stylus for capacitive screens that works with this app but I prefer to use my fingers.The main feature that I love is the ability to import a picture from the phones camera. I often have small sketches/doodles on post-it notes or scrap pieces of paper, I can then take a pic with my phone and work on my rough sketch on Sketchbook Mobile. You don't always have your sketchbook when inspiration hits you, but you always have your cell phone on you!The only downside I can think of is that you don't get the pressure sensitivity on a phone that you'd have on a Wacom enabled device (not the fault of the app I guess) but I'd love to try this on one of the tablets that do have a Wacom stylus.I recommend this for anyone who likes to draw/sketch. From the amateur to the pro. It is absolutely worth the price
2	B004LUS390	I was hoping that there would be more instructions.  This is a paid product, because of that unless it is something you know how to use I would not recomment it.  I will work on it more when I have free time but at this point it is a no for me.
3	B004LUS390	This app is amazing on my EVO. There are dozens of brushes, the ability to work in numerous layers, and a very friendly interface.  I was excited to see that layers could be hidden.
3	B004LUS390	So fun... Especially when you can import any image and photos straight from your stash. I already edited a pic of the wifey and sent it to one of her co-workers. YAAAAAAH it's printed out and hanging on a few cubicles now... Thank you guys for making it the FAOTD
3	B004LUS390	Love this app for crating some really cool art. Takes a lot of practice to learn how to work the app the way you want. The tools are really cool! I like SB Mobile better! Surf the web and watch videos of people making pictures on their phones with this app!
3	B004LUS390	I was using the free version, which works great, and the reviews for this paid version was making me think I would regret the purchase. I went with my gut and installed the app with no troubles.When I first opened it, I kept waiting for something to go wrong, and nothing did. I used every brush and effect, added many layers, saved the work into the apps gallery, and re-opened it with no problems, then saved the image to different formats.I have had no problems with this app as of yet, 5/7/2012, and hope to never experience any. Also, this app is accurate to the touch and supports pinch-zoom.
3	B004LUS390	Very nicely done app, very nice features, superior graphic editing ability on smartphone- would give five stars if it didn't crash when asked to open a photo.
1	B004LUS390	After working for a half-hour on my &amp;#34;masterpiece&amp;#34; I touched a nondescript icon in the upper left that I thought would save it, and instead it cleared my canvas with no warning. So, a low grade for user interface design!
1	B004LUS390	I am very disappointed to not be able to shade or blend things. Also desperately needs an "eye dropper" feature, to copy formerly used colors.Without these, it is to much of a kids drawing app, granted, better than kids, but falls some where in between.Will not save to my photo albums. Granted, the HD Fire is not advertised as a camera device other than for Skype. I do use my camera, and need the ability to save my work to the roll, so I can show others easily. For me it is imperative I be able to save to the camera roll.This doesn't have the amount of brushes and other tools as advertised. Very misleading.I will be looking for another app that I can actually paint with. If anyone knows of one for the Kindle Fire HD, please, leave a comment in the comments section. Thanks!Fix these issues, and I will re- rate.
2	B004LUS390	This seems like a cool app. I just haven't played with it enough to know what it can do. My two-year-old isn't so impressed, but I'm excited to test it out.
3	B004LUS390	*please see update added for FAOTD 10/25/13*quick FYI to start: there are some one star reviews about an update making this useless in the kindle fire but another update fixed that. WORKS JUST FINE ON THE KINDLE FIRE. no question this is my favorite drawing app I have. except for a volor book app for the kids all the rest are now sitting in the cloud. there are several choices not only for pen/pencil/brush types but also for sizes and textures. as far as color choices: endless. the way that the  color customizing works there isn't a color you can't find. you can customize with red/yellow/blue scale and/or use the color wheel to find yhe exact shade you want. you van save any customized colors for easy access later on. without a doubt my favorite feature is the dual paper thing. imagine a drawing with a clear/see through paper on top. this enables me to take my drawing and,  if I want to add something but am unsure as to the effect or whether I will like it or not, I can try it out first on that see through paper type option. if I like it then add it to the original an if not just delete it. LOVE IT!!!! there is an option for a mirror effect (whatever you draw on one half of the paper is automatically mirrored on the other half.there was obviously a lot of thought and care for the app and the customer put into this sketchbook and for only $1.99 it's definitely a bargain.UPDATE FOR FAOTD 10/25/13: there have been quite a few changes since I placed this review. there have been several of the pen/pencil/brush styles added, including texture ones like newspaper print (black dots), outdoor stuff (leaves, grass, wood, flowers), bubbles, google eyes, metal, spine (yes, backbone), rainbow, bamboo, people figures (kid swinging, man with umbrella, parent with child to name just a few), animals (butterflys and bugs), quote bubbles, arrows, checkmark and "no" sign. there is a pop-up menu where you can put your most used brushes and colors. there is an additional way to choose your color. now you can use the wheel with customizer, but you there are two different panel color charts to choose from. if you use the above mentioned dual layer technique you can use more than one at a time. each update just adds so much more to this already wonderful and fun app. it continues to be my favorite drawing app, and I'm quite sure you will enjoy it very much.
3	B004LUS390	Maybe I'm just not very good at it, but all the sketching programs I can find for my mobile device claim to be great for capacitive screens, but I can never get any illustrations to have the detail and responsiveness required to do anything even resembling the quality of the illustrations in the screenshots. I have serious doubts they were created within the software. I also use a WACOM pad on my PC, and I can do great stuff with that, but even with a capacitive pen, I can't do squat on my mobile screen.However, I'm only docking it one star for this because it does seem to have a lot of good tools, and intuitive features, so I guess that's a bit better than the competition, especially since they all have the same issues with capacitive screens.
3	B004LUS390	I'm not very good at using art programs even on a pc. I always wanted one where I could draw almost like I can on paper, and this one is it. This is everything I had hoped to see in an art application. The free ones don't even compare. It does take a little getting used to, but it is worth the effort, and the price.
3	B004LUS390	I read all the reviews and only received negative feedback. I took a chance with this app and I must say its the best 2$ I ever spent on my kindle. I wish I would have discovered this app a long time ago I would have save 500$.
1	B004LUS390	Couldn't be happier with this application. Lots of good tools easy to use once you get used to the interface. Not something that your young kids would like, because the interface is somewhat complicated.
3	B004LUS390	SketchBook Mobile is a very usable drawing app that works great on my Kindle Fire. This app has a huge range of features that allow for real art to be created, including many brush and pallet options that gives the user great control. I have been using this to jot down ideas and sketch out ideas for our shop, but have also played with artistic drawings which is a lot of fun. Drawings can be saved and attached to emails as well.This is a very good app that was an Amazon &#34;Free App of the Day&#34;, but is worth buying if you need a good drawing app.Highly Recommended!CFH
3	B004LUS390	I down loaded this to my HTC phone and though it works like it is supposed to it is hard to use to make anything useful.  I use AutoCAD and other Autodesk products every day, and have for about 20+ years, and this might be good on a desk top but I bet it would be great on a tablet with a stylus (though I don&#8217;t have access to that) it could be great there.
3	B004LUS390	I think I'd like this better in a larger format, but it's a great little app and does what it's supposed to do. The Kindle is just too small a surface and the cheap standard stylus is too imprecise for such a small format. Fun for messing around. I'm not switching it out for my paper sketch book just yet though.
1	B004LUS390	This is probably an OK app, if it is what you need and you knew how to use it. There are no clear instructions. I played with it for a while. It seemed OK, but I couldn't really get anywhere with it. ALSO, I really did not like the idea of it including the Flurry Analytics in the program. I have heard bad things about this. I tried to use the "opt out" option, but it wouldn't let me. I guess this app really just wasn't for me...I deleted this app.
3	B004LUS390	I cant seem to find anything wrong with this app like others have mentioned... it's as fun as the free version and for 99&cent; not bad at all! I love it.
2	B004LUS390	The app seems to work fine with all brushes and sizes and hot areas of the screen, but cannot change line colors on the nexus 7.
3	B004LUS390	Short of a few features such as *actual* blending, this app is an artist's dream. Layers, size, opacity, recommended colors plus a slew of options makes this app the best in its class. Keep up the good work!
3	B004LUS390	Love the app, especially since it was a FAOTD, but I wanted basic, and it definitely isn't. Great if you want to do alot, and a big learning curve if you want to doodle.
1	B004LUS390	I cant figure anything out the Colorado are hard to find and when I try to draw it wont let me
3	B004LUS390	as a graffiti  artist and working on being. character designer this app is amazing I use the bug version on the computer with a wacom cintique amd on a phone with a stylus for the evo 3d its really usefull for practicing small post parts such as eyes, ears, hands feet. on mg Toshiba Thrive table and again using a stylus the sketchbook version is 5.99 and it woo was well worth the Money with that I practice mid shots, or face renders, and sometime i just sketch by observation. and most important my graffiti. just fyi. I don't do graffiti as in vandalism. but on paper I'm a mural style but useing grafifi techniques.Anyways i recommend this to anyone who has a good phone that has 2.2 and up. hopefully 2.3 for better performance. amd anyone who has an android tablet as well I recommend gettin that version as well. its a great tool for practice. and for touch screen there are stylus's out there for phones for this exact purpose although they can bs used for anything.in the end. buy it if you haven't. amd if you have a tablet buy that version as well. amd if you have the $1,000+  well that's how I paid when i gotit before I could get a discount.) to buy it for a computer, pc or mac. then do that as well. you can transfer your files from one device to another and maintain your layers.
1	B004LUS390	I cannot rate it because it does not work on my Flytouch 3 Android 2.2 tablet.I thought it looks really cool.Perhaps they will update it so I can use it someday since I did pay for it.I had to rate it before submitting this review so I gave it 1 star. That is not an indication of how the program functions on a device that will run it.
3	B004LUS390	The overview doesnt tell you about everything, like what does that icon on the top that turns into a mirror image of itself do?  Definitely needs better documentation.  More importantly, you need to allow me to disable the double tap undo feature.  Simply drawing in the left corners caused my entire drawing to delete itself, because the program thought I double tapped.  Now when I start a new drawing, I draw an inch border down the left side to hopefully prevent that from ever happening agajn, but I shouldn't have to do that.
2	B004LUS390	its a good product, but recommend using a stylus kinda hard to get detailed with your finger. would give 5 stars if the UI wasn't so user unfriendly there is a tutorial but its really short and all you do is hit next, would like it to walk you through doing something.
3	B004LUS390	Worth every cent. Sketchbook is the standard for digital drawing and .99 cents is nothing for all the features offered. Updated often and I've never had any issues. A must get for anyone interested in art.
3	B004LUS390	This app had me unsure at first. I draw on physical material, not computers but I picked up the express version, played with it. and downloaded the full version five minutes later. the tutorial isn't very helpful and I accidentally erased entire layers of work,so be carefully and save often, but its an amazing tool on my kindle fire's ample screen. I'm amazed at what you can do withva sensitive touch screen like the fire's. I made my own stylus just to use this app better. anyone who is artistically inclined will have a fabulous time, if you are looking for a Doodle app for your child, do not purchase this app. try the express version if your skeptical definantly worth the .99&cent;.(In order to save your work you must buy the full version)
3	B004LUS390	Works great for a doodle. Scales properly on my tablets (Touchpad/nook) and on my phone. Would probably be best with a stylus. Has many options and features. Great app.
3	B004LUS390	This is my favorite drawing/sketching program for Android, note that they have four versions, free/paid for tablets and free/paid for phones. They recently added arbitrary canvas size which was almost the last feature I wanted. What it is still missing is selection tool (as of 2013/11/27).It has lots of different brushes, layers etc. Very simple to use, pretty much everything it can do is fairly obvious (by looking at the menus). I mostly use it to play around so can't say if it's professional quality but I love drawing with it.
3	B004LUS390	I work with photoshop at work and this is not just a cheap clone, and I would say that without having used PS, I would still be equally impressed with this app. I have a droid milestone which is old and crappy, and but this app runs perfect
3	B004LUS390	This works perfect in KF, and I'm getting sick of the lieing reviews, it messes things up for shoppers. Kids need to clean there frigen files and learn how to operate there KF. You cant just exspect for it to clean its self.. I would be more then happy to help others learn, simply e mail me, if you can't find my e mail, again you don't belong writting reviews then.. It's EZ, when you SEEK!.. #1 Drawer I love it..
3	B004LUS390	I saw this app and immediately thought "Whose line is it anyway", sketch comedy gold.  It turns out this app is about actual sketching.  Not really that funny at all.  I was able to draw my disappointment with the app though, so that's a plus.  Then I started to draw scenes from "Whose line is it anyway", that made me feel much better.  It is a pretty decent drawing app with many features, sadly comedy geniuses like Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, and Wayne Brady are not to be found.
3	B004LUS390	Love the concept for this so much, and maybe my touch screen simply isn't responsive enough (HTC Amaze).  Most of the time it does a fantastic job for basic outlines and designs, but anything too detailed simply won't translate well on a mobile phone.  I'd love to try this out on a tablet; I bet it's fantastic.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app. It is one of my favorites. For the budding artistor the pro.  Highly recommend it to anyone.
3	B004LUS390	WHAT IS SKETCHBOOK MOBILE?Sketchbook Mobile is a game especially made for an artist. It includes many tools to use so you can make the perfect piece of art on your kindle.WHAT I LIKE:There are so many choices on Sketchbook. The app has so many tools to modify your brush, whether it's the color or the thickness. It really has so many choices for you so you can have your picture made just how you like it. Sketchbook has nice graphics so you can admire your creation clearly. It's not just a simple coloring and drawing game. I like how it's very advanced, but simple to use. If you love to sketch, this is the app for you.WHAT I DISLIKE:This app costs two dollars, and there is a free version. Although, this edition is more advanced and has many more options. The free one a nice app too, but I think it's more fit for beginners. If you have a huge passion for art I suggest paying two dollars for this version.
1	B004LUS390	SketchBook Mobile EXPRESS (free) had same problem of FORCE CLOSING as soon as you tapped on the editor, little black square, with a sorry it unexpectedly closed notification. Now THIS dog does the same thing, only it also does so when pressing the colored swirl icon. Dont ask me what that icon is supposed to do, because it forced closed. You think they would have fixed this by now, its been months!!! My advice would be to download it while its free in hopes that they fix it in the future so you dont have to pay for this dog in the future, only to find out that they DIDNT fix it.
2	B004LUS390	Is good and works well, though a little complicated to be used in small screens. works much better on tablets.
2	B004LUS390	I loved this app! its awesome and brilliant...unfortunately I updated to latest version and I cannot even open the app now...keeps forceclosing on me when I try to open it....please fix!
3	B004LUS390	this is a great app. people who get stuff free and cheap always are classy people. we just have a bunch of wally mart shoppers here. nobody is ever happy. they always want something for nothing. this is a great app and has awesome functions. it is hard to use and has many features. I will have to spend some time.. I don't get people bad review cuz its to complex bad review cuz no options. stay home and develop your own apps or shut up. thanks dev sorry for this but I can't hold it in anymore, great app and very fun... keep up great work.
3	B004LUS390	Disclaimer: I hardly have an artistic bone in my body. I played with this and didn't get very far. My son is the artistic one. And I've been quite amazed and what he has been able to pull off with his phone. It is good for him while passing the time and tapping into his creative juices. It is a little bit hard to figure out how to get around in the app but once he got proficient he seemed to be able to fly between different activities.We got this on the day it was free. We both have EVO 3D's and it worked just fine on it. Installed and opened without any problems. We have both never suffered from any forced closures. So this programming seems pretty steady.If you are artistic, you should consider this with it being only two bucks. Get past the learning curve and I think you couldn't do any better with what is currently available in the market.
3	B004LUS390	I'm still sampling what's out there.  This is a fairly complex app, even though it's not Sketchbook Pro, which I assume is moreso.  There's definitely a learning curve.  However, if you take the time to familiarize yourself with the navigation and to explore the possibilities offered by the interesting and very adjustable brushes.  It's especially worthwhile if you invest in a stylus (I use a Sensu Brush on my Nexus 7) so you can do more precise work.  Two warnings: first, you should save your work often because it's too easy to hit the wrong icon and lose your image forever--there's no automatic save.  And second, I can't find any documentation or instruction manual for this program!  It came with sort of YouTube video, which didn't work, and was for Sketchbook Pro anyway.  Have looked on line with no luck.  So you're on your own learning this app.  But I still think it's worth the time and effort.
3	B004LUS390	This app does everything! I mean everything! For an artist or creative person this app rocks! Thanks Amazon! and auto desk!
1	B004LUS390	The app works pretty well, but was not as easy to use as advertised. If you have a lot of patience to learn it I can see this app being very good, but I like apps that are easier to use and simple to learn, so this is not for me.
3	B004LUS390	I've used SketchBook Pro on the iPad, and it's a great app. I was a little leery of how it would run on the smaller screen of my Kindle Fire, but it works very well. And if you've used similar drawing software before, SketchBook will be fairly intuitive to learn.I let some of the nieces and nephews (ages 8-11) try SketchBook last weekend, and they loved it. Two of them want Kindles for Christmas, but now that they've played with Sketchbook on my Kindle Fire, I know they're going to be asking their parents for Fires instead of an e-ink Kindle.But SketchBook is not just for kids. The app has many of the features and options that you would expect in much more expensive software.Overall, SketchBook is one of the best apps that I've tried in the Amazon Android app store. And it's a lot of fun to play around with
3	B004LUS390	This is an excellent drawing app for drawing on my tablet. It has so many different possibilities on the fly. Definitely worth the price.
3	B004LUS390	I didn't think this world be worth my time, but boy is this a fun app.  Using this app is very intuitive and works like you would expect it to. Fun to play with when you need to waste some time.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app. I may use it more than any of the other apps on my fire. no crash problems at all. works flawlessly.
1	B004LUS390	I got this app on sale thinking "Autodesk must make a good drawing app". I tried it 5 or 6 times now and it continues to frustrate me. I have a good drawing and PC back ground. I use Photoshop, painter and paper too but I find Sketchbook lacking.Specifically... No brush blend mode, very week manual, slow, not precise, and generally not much better than any free drawing app.If you like drawing just look up one of the many free apps.Sketchbook... skip it.
3	B004LUS390	I bought a kindle fire as a gift for my young daughter,She is artistic so on the first day I bought the Sketchbook Mobile and Drawing Pad app. I have to give ease of use to the Drawing Pad app with its simple brush selection set up. The first few days she used Drawing Pad almost exclusively, however as she got more comfortable with drawing on a digital device I sat down with her and showed her how to use layers and opacity for blending on the Sketchbook mobile and now it is all she uses.Pro's:Layers- So far this is the only app I have seen that uses layers, and uses them well. Moving between layers or hiding them is an easy thing once you have done it once. It just works. You can also import other images as a layer...a must have feature.Zooming and moving- Zoom in and two fingers on the screen moves the area your looking at. You can zoom very close in and it has brush sizes small enough to take advantage of very detailed changes.Brush Selection- All the basics are here, and a few odd ball ones as well. I would like to see one with "thicker" looking brush stroke lines (like oil paints look on Drawing Pad) but generally if we wanted it do do something it was available.Con's:Blender- No Blender?! This is a big con one, and apparently one the ipad version doesn't suffer from. With this many layers and selections they need to put a blender tool on this. Instead of having to pick 4 different opacity to blend a color I would really like a simple blender tool. Not getting 5 stars without a blender tool. I spent ten minutes looking for this because I just assumed it was there and I was missing it its conspicuously absent.Some Lag- At times the stylus would just not register. Normally this was right after a zoom and just slightly zooming in or out would fix this problem. It isn't that noticeable but it does happen. I would still give this 5 stars if it just had the lag as it is so rare.Overall:Best featured drawing/painting app I have seen so far on the android market, most features you would expect on a high end drawing program are here. It does have a learning curve and better customer support (or a help page just for the fire) and a blender tool would make this a 5 star app. As it is 4 stars and definitely worth the 1.99. After getting past the learning curve my ten year old uses this more than any other drawing app and as much as any other app period (its saying something when you can get someone that age to do something besides play plants vs zombies)
3	B004LUS390	I have been using Autodesk products for several decades, and have never been disappointed.  With a little patience and experimentation, some amazing arteorks can be created.
3	B004LUS390	closest thing to photoshop on mobile (way closer to photoshop than the actual photoshop app). love this app, bought it months ago, saw it was the app of the day and had to share a review
2	B004LUS390	It's OK. Considering it's from Autodesk one would expect more support/updates. I don't use it nearly enough since getting phone upgrades.
3	B004LUS390	it works good as a drawing app. basic tools and functions. auto desk usually makes very high end engineering drawing software.
3	B004LUS390	Great FAoTD
3	B004LUS390	This is an awesome app.  If you love to draw, doodle, paint or if you have just ever wanted to dabble this app is for you!
1	B004LUS390	This app would be awesome if it worked. I get force close when adding a photo to the background. My devices are HTC Desire (Froyo) and HTC Sensation 4G (Gingerbread). Please update....
3	B004LUS390	I ENJOY this app. I love to doodle and play around, real fun :) I would like there to be more explanation on how to use the different mediums...
3	B004LUS390	Still figuring out everything you can do with it and how to do it but so far it's a lot of fun.  My granddaughter and I have made some pretty impressive art with it.  It has a feature that duplicates what you do on one side on the other side so if you draw half a heart, the other half appears on the other side.  We like that one.  It has various tools to make different lines,, too.  Like I said, we are just getting started with it but so far it is really a fun outlet for our artistic side.
3	B004LUS390	I have big hands n fingers in which makes it hard for me to do stuff like in the intro video for this app again sweet app but would love to have the stylus pen he was using in the video
1	B004LUS390	I'm very familiar with Illustrator and Photoshop, so I recognized what some of the icons are in this app. However, I could not figure out how to use this app to make much of anything. Instructions would be wonderful to have. And access to the drawing tools without having to back out of the drawing would be great. In the end, I just gave up and uninstalled this because it is too frustrating to use. Thankfully it was an FAOTD so I didn't waste my money.
1	B004LUS390	App crashes when trying to import pic from gallery, at least since 1.4.0.  And Vic is right, UI is not in intuitive.  I guess it's just good for new drawings by hand.
3	B004LUS390	What kind of stylus is being used in the demo video?  Is a stylus required to use this app effectively?
3	B004LUS390	This is one of my favorite apps on my kindle, it is sooo worth the money.  I am very happy with it. it is on my favorites list. Very easy to use. If you are still not sure about it, the free version is very similar it is called SketchBook Moble Express I think. It is a very good app once again.
1	B004LUS390	It's a relatively decent application, so it puzzles me on why they feel the need to include Flurry Analytics in with the program. It says that you have the option to &quot;opt out&quot; of them collecting information from your device but it makes me leery that they would put this unrepentant garbage on people's personal devices to begin with. And how do I know once they have it in there that they'll behave and close the open hole they drilled in my device to siphon my information? At the very least, READ and opt out on the settings page. Flurry ain't nothin' nice so beware of them getting their hooks in...
3	B004LUS390	I love this app. It has finally allowed me to work on my art on the go. The variety of tools is great and the ability to layer is the thing I've been looking for.
3	B004LUS390	I find this ap to be a lot of fun. Unlike some others, I don't think it is difficult to figure out how to use. I am not very good as an artist but I still have fun with it and like that I can save the ones I want.
3	B004LUS390	This is the best art and graphics app, available in Android. I use the Mac version to develop games with and it works superbly. There is no better alternative, get it now, you won't be sorry! DROIDX2.2.1
3	B004LUS390	Incredibly useful,  feature rich drawing application.  Quite possibly the finest on the mobile scene. 6 layer. psd support! Numerous,  configurable brush types,  slick interface.  What's not to love here? As the free app of the day,  this ones a no brainer. Grab it!  -SGS II
1	B004LUS390	It's fine that there are plenty of brush shapes, but there are a lot of novelty shapes. There is no soften tool, so blending is done by changing colors frequently. There is no hardness option, but presets have different edges which help with blending. I basically need layers, offset cursor, and an eyedropper. I can't move layers. The cursor has a little lag at the lowest settings. If the eyedropper is set to appear when hovering the cursor, it appears when moving the cursor. This makes the program unusable. Support said they'd look into the speed at which the cursor has to move before the eyedropper request is canceled. It's been a month, and the obvious bug is still present. I, like a lot of artists, pull colors from the artwork and the pallet we create on the canvas. Not being able to do this on the fly makes the program unusable. The other way to get the eyedropper is to go through 3 steps. Initial color selection is 4 steps. When I mentioned this to support, he said I should have bought the pro version if I'd wanted to pick colors in 2 steps. LOL. The pro version wasn't available for the Fire at the time. Why would I be sold a crippled program and then be told to give more money for a program that is more streamlined? Why would I want to "upgrade" when the developers can't fix a simple bug. The support guy suggested that all that had to be done was to change one number in the program.
3	B004LUS390	Intuitive. Lots of tools and you can get something pretty cool out of it. It's worth trying, if you want to feel creative while wasting a bit of time.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app.  It is amazing that you can do so much drawing and layers with your phone!  It is wonderful just to doodle and have fun!! luv it!
2	B004LUS390	Great app before the last update. Hope these guys get the message. Using a kindle fire, for reference. The latest update introduced quite a bit of lag when drawing.The app gives you a lot of control over your art and has multiple brushes and opacity settings that allow you to.blend textures and mix color. Not at all a had app, I'd even go as far as saying it's the best when it comes to drawing apps.The latest update knocks the score down a star, however. I paid $2 for this, I could have kept the free version for doodling but I chose to invest in this app. Cause I believe!
1	B004LUS390	This is probably a good app if one knows how to use it, I could not find clear instructions so I played with it a bit and just kept going around in circles. Ended up deleting it since I could not get anywhere with it. You may think it is obvious how to use, but I have learned that you never assume others are on the same page as you. Better to bore them with detailed instructions than to assume they know how to use. Maybe the paid version is better, I don't know.
3	B004LUS390	This is a great application.  At first I was just doodling some 8-bit or stick figures to send my wife tiny comics, but then I picked up a touch pen that worked on my android, iPhone and iPad and suddenly I had a fully featured art program.  I think something like this should come standard from the major carriers because it is so easy to use and encourages creativity.
3	B004LUS390	This by far is one of the best Sketch app with features on Android. Works well both on phone and tablet, good for note taking and for kids to do their sketches or whatever they're in the mood of. Would recommend this app for the creative ones, possibilities are endless.
3	B004LUS390	This application is a great mobile drawing station, and isn't hard to use at all. Works on my droid 1 with no problems. Though my xoom is a different story. Lag issues and no landscape option makes for an unpleasant experience. Update or release new tracker version please.
3	B004LUS390	App is very easy to use had a little bit of a hard time in the begging, then I watched the video on the app page and figured things out.  Still haven't drawn a master piece, but does help pass the time.
3	B004LUS390	I have tried this app many times in trial mode and have been tempted many times to buy it. Thank you Amazon for offering it up. Brings out my inner artist and provides most any tool the mobile artist could want. Sophisticated interface is surprisingly easy to use. Love it!!
3	B004LUS390	I only have a small amount of time to play this, but this app is extremely similar to the one my art professor uses when he makes sketches on this tablet pc (the really old laptop with swivel screen and a digitizer) and it's very intuitive.It took me a few short minutes to learn the ins and outs of the program and the shortcuts are extremely fast to work with and it's a good barebones version of photoshop.The only thing is, now I have the urge to go buy a stylus so I can make better use of this app. I'm no fan of "finger painting" so I wanna get a proper stylus so I can draw on this thing properly.
1	B004LUS390	The app is fun, but not very easy to figure out.  I couldn't figure out how to change colors for example.  But if you like doodling, it might not be so bad.
3	B004LUS390	This app was great when I paid for it a and it's a treat for other people to get it as a free app of the day
3	B004LUS390	This app works perfectly on my Droid X and my Motorola Xoom. I enjoy a lot of the features it has to provide as well. This is an app that I will keep installed on my devices for a while. Thanks devs for a nice app.
1	B004LUS390	1st: Downloaded and tried to review privacy, but link goes to page with list of multiple items. Have to scroll through multiple pages to try to find product, then go to that link. Should be a direct link!2nd: Uses flurry analytics. Says can be turned off, but I unchecked to opt out and program unchecked to opt in. I tried multiple times but program kept defaulting back to participate. That is either a huge glitch,or deceptive practice.3rd: Must be connected to internet to use apparently. Using on a kindle, so often don't have WiFi, so that makes it useless for me.I did not actually use product, so cannot comment on that aspect. Deleted because of issues above.
3	B004LUS390	This app is amazing trust me but half way through working on something it says it has to force close and all my work is deleted. Im using this on my kindle fire (idk if that's relevent). Hope this rodent keep happening :(
3	B004LUS390	Real nice app, hard on small screen, but I guess that's my problem, not yours, good app overall, I'll try to use a lot
3	B004LUS390	Best art program available by far for Android. Can't beat the price either. Works great on Motorola Photon. Good job Autodesk!
1	B004LUS390	I am pretty sure that this was offered as faotd a while back. I see a replace button instead of a purchase button.I saw this on the full site : You purchased this item on November 18, 2011.I guess this means that we can now expect more repeat FAOTD.
3	B004LUS390	This app is incredible, especially for the price. If you like to doodle whatsoever, buy this app. The amount of features, and how well they work, i'm impressed. Never thought i'd be working with layers on my phone. And I can't say i've created any mobile masterpieces yet, but if you take the time..the tools are finally there to create something i'd actually consider art, on your phone. Can export the file, maintaining the layers, and work on it in photoshop later. I couldn't be more pleased with this app.
3	B004LUS390	for the kindle fire. responsive, easy to learn, and incredibly robust for a mobile app. well worth your two bucks
3	B004LUS390	Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. This drawing app is just as addictive as a fun game. Lots of pen options and multi layered background capabilities. Wish the undo had more undos, but the dev had to take into account the amount of ram phones have. For the money this is a great buy.
3	B004LUS390	Solid 5 star recommendation. I picked this up as a freebie promotional on the Kindle Fire App Store, but would have paid the retail price after a quick run through the application. It has a wealth of features similar to the PC version. Only drawback is NOT on the application itself but perhaps on the technology it is designed to run on. Tablets (even with a stylus) just are not accurate enough to do fine artwork on such a mobile device. The performance of this app exceeds the devices it is designed to run on. So don't blame the app, the developer did a great job. I use it for simple sketches or a quick mock up of a design idea so I don't lose it to my vast cerebrum before I get a chance to get it to paper or other media. If you can pick it up for free, don't pass it up. If you have to spend a bit for it, don't pass it up. Just beware that it is likely the hardware that will limit your use of this app, not the app itself. Draw on dudes!
3	B004LUS390	This is the best drawing/doodling app ever created for Kindle. There is so much different types of brushes you can use, customize colors, and so much more. I would recommend this to anyone!  ROCKS!!!
3	B004LUS390	Far exceeds expectations!  Can actually make accurate drawings on a phone! The ui is extremely well thought out and refined.
3	B004LUS390	I've been waiting for this to be the FAOTD forever since I downloaded the Free version. It doesn't get much better than this for drawing on a phone. Lots of features too.
3	B004LUS390	I love this app to doodle on. Just fun when I want to draw something really quick on my nexus 7 to show to someone.
3	B004LUS390	I like the app and all of the choices that you get. I have made some cool drawings and to me it is like doing it on paper, but doing it electronically. I have found it useful for when you are board. :) :) :) I hope you enjoy it.
1	B004LUS390	For an unknown reason this and many other purchases that I made from  Amazon Android Apps are not working in my phone and Tablet, and including my app for Android Apss have been deleted by Amazon. I bought all of those apps and Amazon cannot avoid my use of them. That's illegal so I can sue Amazon for that.
1	B004LUS390	I really llike this app, but since tthe 4.4 Kitkat update, I can't export pictures. The app crashes every time I try, no matter what I try to export. I imagine you've already updated it on google play, so please do so here. I would really love to enjoy tis App again and will give you 5 starts when it's repaired.
3	B004LUS390	This app is definitely one of the best sketching apps for note 2. With so much features it is definitely a must have!
3	B004LUS390	Agreed with most of the reviewers and their comments that this app does deliver infinite possibilities to bring out one's creativity on a mobile device. But a user like me who can barely draw a line straight on paper had tough time drawing anything sensible using this application. You should get a good quality stylus to fully utilize the capabilities of this application. The ability to use existing photos and adding text was nice feature but somehow I did not find enough fonts other than 'Sans'. Not sure if that is my tablet's limitation or the application's limitation.Overall I am rating this with 4 stars instead of 5 because of including 'flurry' analytics in a paid application.
3	B004LUS390	This application is more fun and sophisticated than I expected. I'm not really a great artist, but it's still fun to play with. Sometimes I download coloring book pages from the internet on my Fire and then open them with this application so I can color them in. I really like that I can easily zoom in and out to edit finer details.
2	B004LUS390	Crashes instantly. 3 stars for a quality experience before. 5 if developers are willing to fix it. This is a beautiful app and worth paying for as soon as a fix is made.
3	B004LUS390	I use this on a 7" Polaroid tablet, which I got primarily for a digital sketch/art pad.This is the best program I have found so far for drawing/painting on my tablet.  It takes awhile to get used to zooming in and out to get finer details, but, I think that might be for any program on a tablet, as I'm having to adjust from the touch of dsi screen to a tablet screen.There is a color selector that has basic colors AND a color wheel that allows you to choose many many different colors/shades/tints.The pen/brushes begin with simple tools, but when you open up the tool selector, there are then 3 pages of various pens/paintbrushes AND you can further vary these with a screen that you can pull up, with opacity/transparency, angle, "soft" "solid" "hard", etc.  (You can spend a lot of time just playing around with the pen/brush editor, add to that the colors and, well, it can distract you from your actual drawing/painting!)It doesn't change orientation (is set in portrait) BUT I turned my tablet to do some images in "landscape", save them, put them in a simple photo program on my computer, rotated it (it saves as "portrait") and there didn't seem to be any quality loss, if there was, I couldn't tell it, as the image was large enough to display well on my computer screen.  It also printed well, at least in a smaller size, (5x7 I think I used, maybe 4x6).As far as I can tell, there is NOT "cut & paste" or selection of image to manipulate, but, that's ok as I usually want to have the feeling that I am working on a drawing board or at an easel, (with the convenience of being able to erase/save a copy/try different variations).Yes, to improve your experience,you do have to quit out of the program every so often, about a little over an hour or so, to keep the zooming from jumping around, but, actually, it forces you to take breaks from all the drawing/painting you are doing!  Just "save a copy", get up & stretch, etc., select your image, and continue.Good quality of completed images.  One more thing:  The images do not seem to save to the actual SD card, it saves in a file that says sd card on it.  I am able to get to them from my computer (older one, so it should work on most anyone's computer) through the USB cable, looking up in "My Computer".
1	B004LUS390	i have worked super had on stuff and every time i get far on a peace of work it stops working and when i save my picture and try to bring it back its super small... im really pissed off.. i payed 2 dollors for this.
3	B004LUS390	the feature that u can fade the pics in ur gallery is so handy and cool. when I'm bored, I just take a picture of an object and I start drawing it. this app is very well made and if u learn how to work with it, u can draw pretty pics. HTC thunderbolt
3	B004LUS390	this app is amazing but I do disegree with the casaul doodles I like the way it is setup and overall bu this app if you like drawing sketching whatever you want to call it buy it buy buy buy buy therefore by it /
3	B004LUS390	SketchBook Mobile is a lighter version of the more powerful SketchBook Pro, which in my opinion is among the best drawing programs available for Android right now. To be honest, I was a little skeptical about the practicality of a powerful drawing program on a small screen. But after testing out this app on the HTC One (4.7&#34; 1080P) and Rezound (4.3&#34; 720P), it's definitely doable and actually surprisingly fun.The app has a pretty intuitive user interface optimized for touch, although there is a learning curve. Fingers will work okay, but a stylus will definitely make it easier to draw finer details with greater control. Neither HTC phones I tested the app with has pressure sensitive screen, which adds a lot to the drawing experience especially with a stylus. I'll update my review later if I get some testing time in with a Note 3, which has both stylus and a pressure-sensitive screen. Layer support is present, and it also supports saving into the usual list of image file formats. I imported a small photoshop file (PSD) with 3 layers and it opened up without problems.The permissions required are reasonable, and the installed footprint on the phone is efficient at 8.3MB. So far, I haven't encountered any ads or force closes/crashes.All in all, SketchBook Mobile is a powerful drawing program where the developer definitely took care to optimize for use on small screen devices. To realize the app's full potential, you probably need a stylus. I'd say it's worth the asking price, and definitely worth checking out today as the free app of the day.
3	B004LUS390	I didn't use this for a long time because the drawing tip options are confusing to find. Once I found the user forums (users helping each other), I found the preferences and love the program now. Normally I debit a star for extremely poor documentation, but this app is so badass, that outweighs the pain of figuring it out.
3	B004LUS390	Devices:  Acer Iconia A500 Tablet and Samsung Epic Touch (SGII)I had the SketchBook Mobile Express (Free) version and recently upgraded to the non-free version.The features that are included and how well it works for the price. With that said.. I wasn't an artist before I got this app.. and I am not an artist AFTER getting this app. And upgrading to the paid version didn't help me with that.But I have a few more tools available and the number of layers increased.  And I am probably using Layers the wrong way - but it keeps me from hurting myself too much when I am tring to make changes :)I was looking for an application that I could take into a meeting and "draw" with... like a whiteboard. And this is way over qualified for that task... but it is such an amazing application I kept it on for when the need arises.
3	B004LUS390	Layers, plus all the basic tools. I like how this app is designed for sketching, without photo editing features. Get a soft stylus to really make some good sketches.
3	B004LUS390	for those who want to get further than doodling as many apps are. the free version of this is good by its self but it was well worth the couple of dollars for full version. this is an artists program. i sat down with it and my first try to paint a banana(no joke). within a half an hour of of using i did it the banana looks exactly like a banana would(amaizing) whether you an artist or even advertising agency this appwould be great for advertising for those spur of the moment ideas that you would have to be done at the office to complete before you forget about the idea. we need great apps like this. this programer abviously new what he was doing. i would give this a 10+ but amazon doesn't go that high. thank you sketchbook mobile.
2	B004LUS390	I have been getting into trying to produce artwork digitally lately and I found this app to be pretty awesome. I searched out multiple apps and found this to be one of the best. The different tools are cool, because using the pencil actually looks like it, etc. You can do a lot of different things with it.  My biggest problems is that it is just difficult to interact with it on a mobile phone. I simply just cannot work with it with my finger. I did have a stylus at some point, but it was not a great one. So, if you want to utilize the mobile version of this app you really need a quality stylus.Personally, I have this on my computer and it is amazing there. I imagine the tablet version is awesome too. The mobile version does not have as many tools and is limited in that way. If you are great with using small devices and have an expensive stylus then this app would work quite well for you.Is it worth the price? hmmmm. perhaps not. But perhaps I am just not that amazing of an artist, lol.
1	B004LUS390	YOu have a perfect picture that you created. you spent days on it and it disappears. don't you just love it now. well I tucking hare it
3	B004LUS390	Well I think it lets you be creative and your self.Everyone who has a ipone,ipad,kindle fire should get this app.
2	B004LUS390	On HTC inspire. I can't get it to stop freezing when I click one of the options. I honestly love this app, and I have a lot of hope for it. When this issue is fixed, my review will shoot up to five stars. It is really frustrating when I work hard on a pic though, and lose all my work due to a freeze.
2	B004LUS390	ok app mean i love all apps but this one is not so great and its hard, but i hope others enjoy it!!
3	B004LUS390	I LOVE this app, but I disagree with the product description that this would necessarily be the right choice for the 'casual doodler.'  I love to draw (though I am not a trained artist) and have used a couple of drawing apps on the PC in the past, so I had some basis for understanding the various icons.  But it still was a high learning curve for me to learn how to use this app.I wish that it had a menu system across the top (a hidden one that pops up when you click the top of the screen) where you could pick colors and other basic commands instead of having to figure out which icon meant what and constantly going back and forth from between screens to change colors.I saw something in the very basic "how to" that comes up when you first open the app about pressing in the middle of the circle where you pick your pen type, but I could never get that to work...I've only been using the app about a week but was a passengar on a car trip earlier this week and made a lot of use of the app then.  With more use, I'm sure I'll discover new options.For an artist, I can imagine that this would be like being a kid in a candy store. It is really a tremendous little package for a very tiny price.  I just wish they'd made it a bit easier for the more novice among us to jump in with both feet.
3	B004LUS390	This is by far one of the best apps I've ever downloaded.  For every one talking about the update, mine did the same thing.  I uninstalled, and reinstalled and every thing was fine.  I think it's more of a phone mistake than the developers.  People I know have this app, and they had no problem updating.
3	B004LUS390	I can not draw for the life of me, but I really had a fun time messing with this app. I would imagine for the casual artist, this would have all of the features a person could need. The only limit for me was the size of my screen, but I can't fault the app for that. This is a dollar well spent.
3	B004LUS390	I like to take pica off the Internet and see if I can draw them except thecolor picker didn't work so I could do any of that.
3	B004LUS390	I am not an artist but I still love it. there is an amazing amount of Colors and no end to what you can draw!
3	B004LUS390	Simply put, I love playing with this little drawing app.  The controls aren't super intuitive, but they can be figured out easily enough.  I've drawn some fairly nice things, and my kid has had a blast playing with it.
3	B004LUS390	I started out with the Sketchbook Express, or the lite version. I was blown away, even though it wasn't the full, even though I couldn't save my art, and it was amazing! Now that I'm in possession of the full, I can't deny I'm in a mobile artist's heaven. No more carrying around paints, pencils, pads of paper, and the other tools that could end up being mess, breakable, and expensive; just my kindle fire. I recommend this 100%!!!
3	B004LUS390	This program seems to work great. My granddaughter loves it and uses it all the time. she says it works better with the stylus than her fingers
3	B004LUS390	I love this app it rox! I can do so much. its great for all ages! bat sometimes it does not draw.
2	B004LUS390	Any artist that has used photoshop before knows about the &quot;layer&quot; system, and is a bit spoiled from using it... I know I am because this app's 6 layer maximum frustrates me to no end. I'm left saving my art and then compressing my layers as a makeshift fail safe. I realize there won't be the same layer customization system in a mobile app as a pc program... but it always leaves you wanting more. Also, this is an autodesk product and not an adobe one. If you've used an autodesk product like 3d max or mudbox, you know autodesk functions can be fairly elusive for a beginner, and with each update, more elusive for the expert. This layout reminds me of the zbrush program in that it even makes it hard for the user knowing where the &quot;save&quot; button is located PLUS there is no autosave feature. I had to do my first drawing over 3 times because I couldn't find the save, and looking through the help guide (in the middle of your project) resets the program. My advice to anyone who gets this app is to save often, and create multiple iterations of your file before you even think about collapsing layers!
2	B004LUS390	I tried this app on both a Thunderbolt (running gingerbread) and an asus tablet (running honeycomb). Overall this is a great app. It is surprising that there is no native support to tablets, although it still works in expanded mode. A second minor annoyance is the fact that there is no landscape support. Working on a phone canvas in portrait gives very limited space, so combined with no tablet support this is very limiting. This leads to the third bug, which is the biggest. The tool to move canvas doesn't work well. The canvas can be moved, but if I move it back I loose the drawing that was outside the phone screen boundary. The information my still be somewhere, but I can't go back and see what was there. In effect, the true canvas size is limited by the phone's screen.
3	B004LUS390	THIS IS AMAZING, AND I AM SO HAPPY!  Thank you so much Amazon!!  :D  I can't wait to start making some mobile art!
3	B004LUS390	I really like this app.It works well as far as creating drawings particularly.  Use a great stylus, though or you'll be severely limited in what you can do.It's intuitive, for the most part, I thinkAnd it transfers well to Dropbox so you can finish your &#34;masterpiece&#34; out.
1	B004LUS390	I really wanted this app but was very disappointed when I found out I can't even use it. Everytime I try to open the app it shuts down. What a waste of $2...:/
3	B004LUS390	Enjoy drew look good pretty. Add picture great looking fun one. Change life, my eyes is all right.for all enjoy.
1	B004LUS390	I can only find thumbnails of my drawings with horrible resolution after spending a long time sketching.  Really disappointed.This app never worked on my kindle fire.
1	B004LUS390	This app was well worth the money on the Kindle Fire...until the latest update.  Now, the screen tries to divide into sections, and when you attempt to draw something, the mark or line appears on each of the sections and about an inch away from your finger or, in my case, stylus.Before, this app was a great drawing app, and went above and beyond anything I would have expected on a mobile device.  However, after the update, the app force closes most of the time when I try to open it, and if it manages to stay open longer than three seconds, the section problem occurs.  Please make this app how it used to be!
3	B004LUS390	it seemed like it would be a sketch book that would bore me but this wanted and begged me to keep writing on it.
3	B004LUS390	This is a very fun app for my Kindle Fire HD.  It would be good for all age groups, as I am a grandmother and enjoy it, but children would enjoy it as well.
3	B004LUS390	Wow. I was blown away by this app. I got it because it was free and looked pretty interesting. Started doodling just to try it out and next thing I know an hour has gone by and I am immersed in an intricate drawing of a turtle.With so many tools and features, it's hard not to get wrapped up in this app if you are at all artistically inclined. I have not drawn since I was young (like elementary school) but within minutes of opening this app I was nostalgically reliving my past and was overcome with that beautiful tranquility you get when you are creating something.Highly recommend.
3	B004LUS390	SketchBook Mobile by Autodesk is a feature rich sketching/drawing/painting program that is the free version of SketchBook Pro.  It provides the tools you would expect such as brushes, pencils, markers, airbrush, fill tool, line tool, circles and rectangles, etc. and the controls such as brush size, color selector, opacity, symmetry, line constraints, circle constraints, etc. that you want in a good art program.  It also provides the ability to work with a couple of layers but if you need a greater number of layers, you need to upgrade to the Pro version.  The Pro version also provides a greater number of each of the tools than what come in the Mobile version.  The Mobile version provides an impressive  amount of functionality for a free program, and even better than many of the paid applications.  I own and use Autodesk's SketchBook Pro 6 on my PC along with a Wacom Intuos Pro graphics tablet  which is a setup many professional illustrator's use to make a living.  But for a general use art program to be used on a phone or a tablet,  SketchBook Mobile is one of the best, if not the best.  The biggest drawback's to using this, or any other art application, is generally not the software, it's the size of the screen and the lack of an accurate input device on most capacitive touch devices, such as phones and tablets.  SketchBook Mobile is capable of producing a wide range of varying types of artwork, more so than the physical limitations of the devices it's used on allow.  But, understanding the constraints, I highly recommend SketchBook Mobile as one of the best, if not the best, free applications for use on mobile devices!
3	B004LUS390	Great job autodesk.this is the ultimate painting app for android. Now I need a tablet to enjoy this even more. anyone that gives this a bad rating either has a old phone or doesent understand graphic design much. this is much more than I thought possible from a mobile application. easily worth the small price tag.
3	B004LUTUTC	I'm happy with this app. It works smoothly for my email and file storage. Id say I am not crazy about the integrated shopping pushiness of godaddy, but the app is free so I have no right to complain.
2	B004LUTUTC	The GoDaddy Mobile app is quite good. It gives you full access to all your folders. The major flaw that I referred to is the fact that web links sent to you in emails are not active,  causing you to have to copy them rather than clicking on them.
3	B004LUTUTC	Like this app.  I only wish it would allow me better ways to find items I need to purchase.  Other than that it is very handy.
3	B004LUTUTC	As an App, the go daddy app links you to do about everything you can do on the go daddy web.
3	B004LUTUTC	I love this Go Daddy app, it puts my account right at my fingertips! Total ease in managing my email accounts and domains. I love the interface with Go Daddy's app.Just a perfect addition to my account....
3	B004LUTUTC	Spent HOURS trying to configure e-mail for my Kindle Fire HD.  With THIS APP.. I simply entered my Domain (They HOST) and Password and it was INSTANTLY set up.  PERFECTION!
3	B004LUTUTC	I have used this App on a Samsung Galaxy Tab (P-100) off & on for 2 years. It works ok, but isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread. It does the job (and the keyboard action from the virtual keyboard on the Kindle Fire HD is superior to that on the P-100).All-in-all, a good eMail App that could be improved.
3	B004LUTUTC	Got the Go Daddy app to be able to see my mail. Does so much more. Too bad I don't need all of it yet.
3	B004LUTUTC	Great app, I really like having access to all my email folders and bulk mail.  The only gripe I have, and it is more the lack of my eye hand coordination than the app, is that when I try to select multiple messages for some action if i miss the box just a little, it opens the message and I have to start selecting all over again.  I would like to see it hold the selections until I leave the folder.
1	B004LUTUTC	I don't like this I didn't know what it was all about.I don't like this I didn't know what it was all about.
3	B004LUTUTC	i use this for my work email and this app allows me to keep in contact with my coworkers and clients on the go. definately wortglh the download.
2	B004LUTUTC	If it was just a mail app it would be perfect, but as it is Godaddy it is full of stuff that most of us will never need.
3	B004LUTUTC	since i am a webmaster i am embedded with go daddy.  And this is a great application for my Samsung phone.  You will have quick access to all your web sites.
3	B004LUTUTC	then you need this app.  Perfect for retrieving mail when on the road or managing your account.  Great company and app is always improving
2	B004LUTUTC	I think GoDaddy has a goal of making apps that suck on every platform, a goal they have accomplished. I put this on my Fire with low hopes and those hopes were met for the most part. The mail on this thing is a nightmare like all GoDaddy mail clients. Normally I wouldn't rate an app that I thought would blow and tell myself instead "I told you so" but as I pay a pretty decent amount for GoDaddy every year I chose to leave a review. Normally I would have given this app a one star but like I said I came in expecting not so good things so this app gets three stars for meeting my expectations. Maybe GoDaddy can spend some of the money I pay them to improve service and less on commercials and automated systems that email me twice a day letting me know in six months my domains will need to be renewed.
1	B004LUTUTC	I could not get this GoDaddy app to work on my Kindle fire 7&#34;.  It was a waste of time and effort.  So it sits in my cloud doing no good for nothing.  I hope you have a better experience!
3	B004LUTUTC	This go Daddy email app works very well. It's 1 of the best utility apps on my Kindle HD. The only thing is I have not found a Log out link. I just have to close the app and hope. Other than that I really like it.
3	B004LUTUTC	This is a good app and was easy to download for checking my work emails. There he never been and issues and is easy to navigate.
1	B004LUTUTC	This app dose not let  do anything with my web sites.all it does is track exporting things and domains you are auctioning off not worth it better off during silk to go to the real website.
3	B004LUW148	I didn't think to much of it at first, but now I cant get enough.  I love how you learn so many new words.
3	B004LUW148	This game is definitely easy to learn bit hard to master. The controls are super simple (just tap the letters you want to make the word out of, in order. and tap the last letter again to confirm the word.) It's easy to find 3 and sometimes 4 letter words but to really rack up points you've gotta go bigger, and that is tough! The timer keeps the pressure on but not to the point where it feels hectic. In fact, I usually forget it's there. All in all, a great game that's easy to play if you have 5 minutes to kill or half an hour.
2	B004LUW148	cant decided it is okay but not one of my favorites i like playing word games to keep my brain working and active.
3	B004LUW148	If you're a sucker for Word Searches, Crossword Puzzles and any other word game. You'll enjoy Wordoid! Even my wife (who dislikes word games) was quickly hooked, and stole my Kindle Fire! My only complaint is there seems to be a lot&quot;Made-up&quot; words. Hope this helps! Enjoy!
3	B004LUW148	Picked this up free from Amazon last week & its a great edition to my android apps. My only complaint is the lack of a pause button. Maybe there is one but I haven't stumbled onto it yet~ Other than that I like the game, be warned it is extremely addictive!!
2	B004LUW148	Not what I was looking for in a word game.  There was not really anything about this game that gave me a .challenge
1	B004LUW148	I AM SORRY TO C ONE REVIEW AND THERE MIGHT B MORE OF ADULT ADDS ON THIS GAME...I ENJOY WORD GAMES BUT SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO UP HOLD TRADITIONAL VALUES...ANN BONETTI
3	B004LUW148	A fun word game that wil definitely get u to use your brain before the time runs out.A good brain exercise.Highly addictive.
3	B004LUW148	This is probably the biggest 'time-waster' app that I have on my phone. I picked it up after watching my wife play it. While it isn't fancy, it still a fun game to play. I wish I could edit the dictionary. I can't complain since it is a free app. Now if I had to pay for it I might have knocked of a star for not having this feature. There are some words that are 'real' but the game doesn't recognize. In addition I hate it when I get too many vowels; however, that is part of the game. You have to strategize to eliminate vowels early in the game to avoid being inundated with them. If you like word puzzles this is definitely a game for you!
3	B004LUW148	Addictive little Boggle-like game with indefinite playing time and the vexing twist of replacing letters after you use them, with more difficult combinations the longer you play. So if you've earned multiple 2-minute bonuses and think you're hot stuff, the game starts replacing consonants you've used with vowels. Huge vocabulary list; great fun for wordophiles.Hint: pretend you're in Europe. It accepts UK English words and spellings and French borrowings more than American slang and Spanish borrowings.
3	B004LUW148	So addicting. Will I ever again see the light of day? How can I take the time from playing the game in order to satisfy the 20 word minimum?
3	B004LUW148	I play it every single day! Even got the neighborhood kids playing it :-D and the grandbaby watches and asks to play! Though it does not accept some words as legit even though I know they're real word's. But all in all I love this game!
3	B004LUW148	I love the challenge of this game.  I'm not that great at it, but I continue to play it everyday.  I would recommend it to any that like word games.
3	B004LUW148	Stress reducer.  Escape from your troubles or even everyday stress with this fun game. Highly recommend.  Ironically, when you are done, it lists your score and the number of words &quot;spelt.&quot;  LOL.  Should be &quot;spelled,&quot; but I get a kick out of the irony and still love the game.
3	B004LUW148	this game is a lot of fun and challenging.  great way to pass the time I learned a few new 3 letter words
2	B004LUW148	This app was ok.  It's a fun game if you enjoy word games, but I am just not a big fan of timed games, so that was my only problem with it.  I think it resembles the game Boggle in a way.
3	B004LUW148	I love this app it is so freaking addictive. I can't stop and I totally lose track of time when I'm playing this game.
3	B004LUW148	Letters and their placement are repetitive, but this is a fun word game nonetheless.  Takes my mind off of real life at least once a week.
3	B004LUW148	Fun game. Easy to play.  Interesting graphics. The drawn game board is more fun than just using tiles.  Works on Samsung Epic.
3	B004LUW148	I really have enjoyed this little app on my Kindle Fire.When I am tired and not in the mood to read I play thisor one of the other Solitaire games, and find this oneeasy to get lost in for a half hour or more, plus itcan't hurt to work the mind with spelling!  Any agecould have fun with this app.
3	B004LUW148	I LOVE the game, but I'd be willing to pay for extras, like an untimed option. Wordoid is simple but addictive, along the lines of Boggle. Highly recommended if Boggle-type games are your thing!
2	B004LUW148	Test device - Samsung EpicGameplay - boggle/word finder type game. Select adjacent letters to form words in a given amount of time. The longer the word you form, the more points you get.  The more points you get, you move up to higher levels.  Twists to this game are that the letters you use up are replaced with new ones, and there are special characters that help add to your score or act as a wild.Controls - You select letters with your finger tip.  Tap a letter twice to deselect it.  Selection was precise and responsive.Graphics - Ok, nothing stellar, but did the job well enough.Sounds - Thankfully not maddening. Sounds can be turned off in the Settings.Stability & Performance - Game played smoothly and I didn't experience any crashes.Extras - Keeps track of your highest score, but there isn't a way to compete against others or post your score.
3	B004LUW148	free and fun but I suck at it...luckily a friend who uses my phone alot also plays this game, a lot.
3	B004LUW148	This works great on my little NextBook tablet, although as noted by others, a few thimgs would enhance play:  Being able to slide over instead of tapping each letter, OPTIONAL timed play, and all caps on letters as some lower case ones are hard to distinguish when trying to beat the clock. Like it a lot overall though.
3	B004LUW148	addicting and fun game for all ages.  works great on the kindle fire and does not need wi fi once downloaded, you will love this game!
3	B004LUW148	I've always loved words, vocabulary, and word search games. Making words out of random letters in a grid is a good challenge. The longer the words, the more score you receive. The round is a little long, I've found. Three minutes is long enough I would say. But the challenge is to hang in there, and keep making lots of words!
1	B004LUW148	My nephew downloaded this on my Kindle. Did not like this game so have removed it from my device. Need to go on Amazon and remove it completely.
3	B004LUW148	This game is great.  I play it everyday and it gives your brain a workout and is fun to play.  You have to quickly tap on letters that make words and the longer the words the more points you get letting you play for longer periods of time.  It quickly becomes a matter of you against the game to keep going before it times out.  You do not become bored playing it because the words picked are all up to you and your speed and an ongoing challenge. All my friends love it.  Try it.
3	B004LUW148	Nice word game.  The instructions were a bit short, but I finally figured out that you need to tap the last tile of your selection "twice" to submit a word, and to delete letters from a word your were in the process of making, you can touch an empty spot one or more times at the top of the game board.  If you want to delete the entire word you were in the process of making, you will be left with the initial letter after the above deletion process, but the letter that you then type next will become the first letter of the word you wish to make, and then you can proceed from there.
1	B004LUW148	This game will not install on my Flytouch Android 2.2 tablet. It sounds as if it would be fun to play. Maybe the next version.
3	B004LUW148	Lots of fun if you like word games. Unique too! Well thought out user interface. Only wish that you could have multiple identities, or at least could clear high score.
3	B004LUW148	enjoy this word game.  my 10 year old grandson also enjoys the challenge of the tam.  we play it together and individually.
3	B004LUW148	Wordoid is quite simply addicting! I start playing and time flies by. I would love to be able to have an option to play without the timer, but is great fun!
3	B004LUW148	Worth down loading. simple interface, simple rules, addictive game play. Works fine on my HTC EVO. Would love the ability to challenge other players/friends.
3	B004LUW148	I absolutely love this game.  very fun!  the only problem is it freezes up at times.  but I still love the game and would refer it. just hope they fix the lil freeze prob.
3	B004LUW148	i really like this game.  This game can be easy by finding just 3-letter words or more challenging by making much longer words. recommend!
3	B004LUW148	I enjoy this app a lot. I play it often. It's fun. And it's simple to use! Keeps me going back for more! Never had a problem with this app working, always has been great!
3	B004LUW148	Great game to pass the time with.  You'll easily get hooked within minutes.  Very simple concept, yet can be very challenging the furthur you progress.
2	B004LUW148	Wordoid is just ok.  I'm glad that I didn't have to pay for this.  There's not much to the game.
3	B004LUW148	Actually, it *is* my favorite Boggle type of game, but there is one thing I wish were different. The game keeps track of highest score but not the highest level achieved.  Other than that, it's great!One proble with such games is that their lists of allowable words are often strange. Wordoid! tells you than it makes use of ENALE2k, so if it allows words you don't like or forbids words you do, at least you know why.The font is not my favorite, but I was hardly aware of it after playing a few games.Another reviewer said there were no ads.  I get ads on my Kindle Fire.  I got one ad that was a bit sleazy, which might make me uncomfortable if I had kids playing this game, but I don't know if that's the fault of the designer or if it's more of an "at random" thing.
3	B004LUW148	REALLY LIKE THIS GAME!!! After playing for a while my brain is still trying to put letters together and form words. I literally have to play a different type of game. It's like getting a song stuck in your head. Lol but in a good way. Go ahead get this one'
3	B004LUW148	Fun & fast...great time waster (and I mean that in a good way!) Used it the other day at another interminable doctor's office wait and the time flew. I was annoyed when my name was called and I had to quit. Getting better at it every day. Highly recommended for fellow slackers and impatient waiting room sitters. Would be happier to be able to toggle off timer. Sometimes I don't need that kind of pressure!
3	B004LUW148	I love word games, and this one is one of my favorite for the Android.This is a lot likeBoggle, on a 5x5 grid, except when you pick a word, then the letters go away. It also has a few special cubes that sometimes appear, like a ? cube, which you can use for any letter, and an orange shaded letter which doubles your score.You get 2 minutes per round, and as soon as you get enough points, then the timer resets for that round, and you move to the next round, which also gets 2 minutes, uses the same board, and requires a few more points for completion. The letters carry over from round to round, so it makes it a fun challenge to try to use the hard letters first so you can score big letters later.Pros:+Very fun+324 KB on my phone+Can be moved to SD card (Appstore moved this automatically for me)+You get exponentially higher scores, the more letters you play+Combines the Q into QU, so q's are always easy to play+Has a great dictionary, with all the crazy Scrabble words, like QUA, JEE, and ZEECons:-Probably a little too easy. Games for me last about 10 to 20 minutes before I "die", so you probably won't play a quick game of this.-Only one mode of game play, even though this mode is very fun-Small onscreen advertisements, but they're out of the way and don't interrupt game play, so they're okayI reviewed version 0.3.1 of this app, on a Huawei Ideos phone
1	B004LUW148	Hated it! It was too hard and I have a fairly extensive vocabulary, also spelling skills.  Don't waste your time.
3	B004LUW148	I like this simple to play app but I think it could use a little more colorful board. I wouldn't mind knowing what the orange letters do for u. It is challenging, play it on my breaks.
3	B004LUW148	My daughter loves to play this game. I personally have not played it but she says &#34;it rocks&#34;. So I would recommend.
3	B004LUW148	If you enjoy word puzzles you will like this one!  I pick it up when I get bored with TV & the time just flies.  Some times it is very difficult & other times is easy so you must keep thinking of new words before the clock runs out!  Fun stuff!!
3	B004LUW148	I love this game. Challenges your vocabulary and thought process. This was the first game that came to mind when a good friend asked me to set up her new Fire to keep her occupied through radiation treatments and she loves it too :)
3	B004LUW148	My brother and I always play this on my kindle. He finally got tired of using my kindle (when he could use his phone) so he downloaded it! I play it all the time when I don't have anything to do. This is a must download!!
2	B004LUW148	This would be a great game if the user could swap or remove some letters.  Sometimes you get way too many of one letter on a board and depending upon their arrangement on the board you cant make a word out of the duplicate letters.
3	B004LUW148	Downloaded. this game when I found out the only. version of Scrabble available. was the app that doesn't allow single player mode.  Made the mistake of buying that for another device.As for this game, I feel it is very good because it is challenging enough to keep the player thinking but not so difficult that a beginner would get frustrated.  Very interesting...and since it is free, no reason not to try it.
3	B004LUW148	this is a very good game. it works perfectly on my Evo Shift. helps to pass the time while i'm on the train going to work.
3	B004LUW148	I recommend this game because you are continually trying to find words in the time allotted. This keeps your fingers and mind in shape.
3	B004LUW148	It is my favorite!  I play this game several times a day.  Very addictive.  And for a freebie you just can't beat it!
3	B004LUW148	So far so good.  Still getting the hang of it, but enjoying the challenge. I would recommend for jumble players.
3	B004LUW148	fun but it gets aggravating when you are given crappy letters and are forced to make 3 letter words. doesn't recognize words that i know are real sometimes.
